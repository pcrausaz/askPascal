Focus is mostly on Non emergencies call handling.... or redirected from 911 or 311, they then handle these calls.

Going after the mom and pops ready to listen to him (small cities and likes). Extend to home alarms and like.... (There seem to be a standard way - in PSAP - to handle emergency call - standard ALARM ....which prevent  the need from people to have to pick up calls....but seems to be an analog standard)

Looking for a platform (looked at deepgram, lack integration in phone systems)...look for more flexibility and idependence. Want to avoid a forklift of existing solution, but come as a add-on...integrate with them...

Looks at AWS Connect, Audio Code and 2600Hz ()

We are competing with Audio code on the account....The NFR is the key element...and the winner for us
