### Details
**Ingredients**

- 40 gr of Powdered Sugar
- 40 gr of Light Brown Sugar
- 4 eggs
- 1 Tiny Expresso
- 4-5 Meringues
- 100 gr of Mascarpone Cream
- 100 gr of Heavy Cream
- 30 gr of heavy cream for the deco


**Method**

1. Oil the mold
2. Separate the yolk from the white, set the white aside
3. In the mixer, mix the egg yolk with the brown sugar, add the expresso, then the heavy cream. Mix a bit, then incorporate the mascarpone cream, then mix well to get some volume
4. In another bowl, beat the egg white to a firm peak, add the confection (Powdered) sugar as you beat the whites.
5. Incorporate the egg whites delicately into the preparation 
6. Crush 5 meringues, set aside about a table spoon of crushed meringue
7. Pour about half of the mixture into the mold
8. Layer the crush meringues on top of it
9. Now cover with the rest of the mixture
10. Place into the freeze for about 2-3 hours
11. For the deco, after 2-3 hours, beat the 30 gr of heavy cream into a Chantilly, incorporate the meringue early on with a little bit of sugar.

Tip: Next time, I'll try to keep the meringue off the side and off the center, this should ensure that top and bottom does not separate when you cut it. Alternatively, a tad more complexe try to have a ring with no meringue just off the outer side of the cake.
