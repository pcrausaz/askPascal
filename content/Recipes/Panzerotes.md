### Details
**Ingredients**

- 1 Kg of all-purpose flour (makes about 20 per Kg)
- 1kg of Emmental
- 1 cubes of fresh yeast (replace with what you have)
- 5 dl of water (but play it by feel)
- 1 dl of olive oil
- 0.5 l of peanut oil
- 2 cans of anchovies
- 3 large tomatoes
- 3 tsp of salt

**Note**: plan for some spare cheese and tomatoes on the first to get a feel for how much you need.


**Method**

1. Mix the yeast into 3 dl of lukewarm water
2. Place the flour into a large bowl and mix in the salt
3. Add some of the yeast-water mixture to the flour
4. Start working the dough and add water as needed until you get a dough that feels elastic and soft. Should need about the 5dl, first add the olive oil, then the water, sometimes a tad more or a tad less water depending on the weather. The whole process should take you about 20 minutes
5. Cover the dough with a cloth and keep at room temperature. Let the dough rest for about 1 hour.
6. After an hour the dough should have more or less double its size.
  1. one option is to make the portion before the dough rise and let the portion rise. Lately this is what I have been doing.
7. Take about 70 gr of dough, then roll it into a 25cmx10cm rectangle. Repeat the operation until you have no more dough
8. Slice the tomatoes into very thin slices, the thiner the better
9. Season the tomatoes with salt and pepper
10. Slice the cheese into very thin slices
11. Open the anchovies can, remove all liquid
12. Stuff each rectangle of dough with a couple of slices of tomatoes and a couple of slices of cheese. Add one anchovie. Place the ingredients on one side about 2 cm from the edge, then fold the other side on top and seal the dough by pitching the dough between 2 fingers. It helps to wipe the edge of the dough with a little bit of the tomatoes juices before folding the side. Once close, you have your panzerote
13. Set the panzerote aside, place it on a cloth so as it does not stick on the counter or table surface
14. Pour the oil into a frying pan
15. Heat the oil at medium-high heat
16. Insert a 2-3 panzerote into the hot oil, watch out for oil burns here, be very careful
17. After 1 or 2 minutes turn the panzerote over and fry another minute or so. Nothing should spill out of the pocket, if it does check the seal and press the dough again if needed.
18. Take the panzerotes out of the oil (keep them a few second on top of the pan to let the oil drip), and place into a bowl lined with a couple of paper towel sheets.
19. Repeat the operation with the remaining panzerotes, inserting paper towel sheets between each new layer of panzerote.
20. Serve as soon as the complete batch is done

**Note**: Mic suggest subtituing a little bit of milk as per Nine's latest adaptation to get a more crispy dough. You can also add a tablespoon of white vinegar which is supposed to make it less oily.

**Warning**: The hot tomato juice inside the panzerote is a killer, so watch out, it is very very hot inside. Eat with care.

Serve with a glass of red wine and eat with your fingers.
