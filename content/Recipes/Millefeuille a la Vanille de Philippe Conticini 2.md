### Details
## Ingredients Inverted Puff pastry

- Detrempe
  - 15 cl Water
  - 1 Tbsp of white vinegar 
  - 18 g of Fleur de Sel
  - 350 g of flour
  - 115 g of unsalted butter (melted but cold)
- Beurre Farine (flour butter)
  - 375 g of unsalted butter
  - 150 g of flour 
- Confection Sugar

The vinegar helps to keep the dough over a few days. Wait overnight between the folding operation helps.


## Ingredients Cream

- 450 g of milk
- 50 g of heavy cream
- 2 Vanilla beans
- 4 egg yolk
- 90 g of sugar
- 50 g of butter
- 25 g of cornstach

## Method Inverted Puff Pastry

1. Start with the 'detrempe'
2. Place the water, vinegar and salt into a bowl and mix until the salt is well disolved
3. Add the remaining ingredient and mix well but be careful to not over mix it, the less you mix it, the easier the dough will be to work with
4. Flatten the dough into a 15cm x 15 cm square
5. Tightly wrap and Place into the refrigerator for about 2 hours or more
6. Next with the 'Beurre Farine'
7. Take the butter out for 30 mns
8. Cut the butter in cubes then mix with the flour until the flour is fully absorbed by the butter
9. Flatten the 'beurre farine' into a 15cm x 15 cm square
10. Tightly wrap and Place into the refrigerator for about 2 hours or more
11. 2 hours later....
12. Lightly flour your work space
13. Flatten your 'detrempe' intro a rectangle of about 8 mm thick
14. Do the same with your 'beurre farine', making sure the butter is twice as large as the 'detrempe'
15. Lay the 'detremple' on the 'beurre farine' and fold to cover the 'detremple' completely
16. Turn your apparatus by 1/4 of circle and flatten the dough to about 8 mm
17. Fold the bottom 1/3 over the middle part then fold the top 1/3 over making sure the 'ends' are aligned.
18. Fold again, but this time using 1/2 over the other
19. Wrap and place into the refrigerator for 2 hours
20. 2 hours later....
21. Flatten the dough into a 8 mm rectangle and repeat the same folding as above
22. Wrap and place into the refrigerator for 2 hours
23. 2 hours later....
24. Flatten the dough into a 8 mm rectangle and repeat the same folding as above (yes again)
25. Wrap and place into the refrigerator for 2 hours
26. 2 hours later....
27. Pre-heat over at 340 F
28. You dough is now ready for use.
29. Flatten your dough to a 5 mm rectangle (over a silk pat or parchment paper) of about 25 cm x 35 cm
30. Place on a baking sheet, add another silk pat or parchment paper on top
31. Refrigerate for 30 mn
32. Lay a baking sheet rack over the dough (to avoid too much )
33. Cook for about 20 mn - but make sure the dough cooked well
34. Ideally it will have rise to 11 mm
35. Take the rack out
36. Turn the heat to 475 F
37. Sprinkle confection sugar on top of the dough and caramelize the sugar for 2-3 mn max.
38. Take the dough out
39. Let is rest 5-6 minutes to cool down, and cut in 3 parts. Make sure to use a serrated/bread knife and adjust all sides. 

  


## Method Cream

1. In a pan, add the milk and the cream
2. Open the vanilla beans, scape the seeds, add to the pan, add the beans as well
3. Bring to a boil
4. Remove from the hear, cover and let it rest for 20 mn
5. In a bowl, add your egg yolks
6. Add the sugar and mix until it whitens
7. Incorporate the cornstarch and flow mixing well
8. Time to place your gelatine sheets into cold water
9. Now temper your egg mixture with a little bit of the milk/cream mixture, mix well, then add the rest, mix well, and move it back into the pan
10. Place the pan over medium heat, bring to a boil and boil for 2 minutes or so....never stop mixing. It must be fairly thick
11. Turn the heat down
12. Cut the butter and incorporate
13. Wrung out the gelatine and incorporate
14. Now use a hand mixer to get to a very fluid mixture
15. Transfer the cream to a bowl, film to contact (plastic wrap touching the cream so as to avoid any air) and place into the refrigerator for 2 hours at least (or speed up the process by placing it into the freezer for 15 mn)
16. Transfer the cream to a mixer and mix the cream for about 5 mns at medium speed
17. In a separate bowl, mix the mascarpone cream to get it creamy then fold it gently into the cream
18. Transfer to a pastry bag (medium tip), use a spoon if you do not have a pastry bag

  


## Method Final Assembly

1. Lay out 1 part of the dough on a working plate
2. Use the pastry bag to layer the cream
3. Place a second part of dough over it
4. Use the pastry bag to layer the cream
5. Complete with the millefeuille with the last layer of dough
6. Refrigerate before serving
7. At the last minute (frankly, I did it 1 hour before serving and refrigerate and it was fine) Use a piece of paper to hide portion of the top layer of the dough and sprinkle confection sugar, repeat to create a pattern.
8. Cut and enjoy the hard work.
