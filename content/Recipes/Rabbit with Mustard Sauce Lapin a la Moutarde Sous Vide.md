### Details
**Ingredients**

- 1 Rabbit
- 1 onion
- 2 Cloves of garlic
- 0.33 cup of wine
- 0.25 cup of cream
- 1 Veg or Chicken bouillon cube
- Water
- 2 or 3 Tbsp of dijon mustard
- Some Thym wigs
- Some laurel leaves
- 1 Tsp of cornstarch
- Salt & Pepper
- Olive Oil


**Method**

**Day 1**

1. Cut the rabbit into pieces, then salt and pepper, set aside liver & heart for a snack. If there is any fat keep it for when bagging the rabbit later on.
2. In a pan, heat some oil, on medium, roast the rabbit 2-3 minutes on each side and set the meat aside
3. Deglaze the pan with with white wine, set the resulting juices aside
4. Because the rabbit takes quite some time to cook sous-vide, I usually do this the day before.
5. Place the juices in a container for use the next day, in the refrigerator
6. Bag and vacuum the rabbit, either a tiny bit of butter or olive oil or alternatively, use the set-aside rabbit fat. Refrigerate till the next day.

**Day 2**

1. Pre-heat the sous-vide bath to 64° C
2. When the water reach the temp, add the rabbit (in bag) and cook for 10-12 hours
3. Later on (evening) when the rabbit is cooked, peel and crush the garlic, slice the onion
4. In a cast iron, heat some oil on medium
5. Add the onion, some salt and cook till the onions are transparent. Toward the end, add the garlic, Thym and Laurel.
6. Add the bouillon cube
7. Add the left over juices that you set aside the day before
8. Dilute the cornstarch into some water, add to the pot
9. Add the mustard, mix well
10. Add some water, maybe 1/3 of a cup
11. Let this reduce a bit, it should become a bit like sirup
12. Add the cream and cook for another 5-10 minutes
13. At this point, strain the liquid to get something smooth (removing onion, garlic, herbs...) and put back the liquid into the pot
14. Get the rabbit out of the bag (no pun intended) and add to the pot
15. Cook another 5-7 mn and serve

  

If you do not have sous vide material, just cook the rabbit into the pot, adding it after you cooked the onion. It will require 60-90 mn to cook at medium low and will require more water. 

You can substitute water for chicken stock.

Serve with rice or pasta or potatoes.
