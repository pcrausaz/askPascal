### Details
**Ingredients**

- 50 g of hazelnuts
- 75 g of pistachios
- 100 g of almonds
- 100 g of honey
- 3 eggs
- 100 g of sugar
- 4 dl of heavy cream
- Pinch of salt


**Method**

1. In a pan, add the nuts, all of them, sprinkle 50 g of sugar on top, then caramelize, medium temperature. Mix often, it will take about 10 mns. When done, set aside and let it cool down
2. When the nuts are cool, crush them, either using a large knife or like I do, stick them in a zip lock bag and hammer the nuts finely.
3. Break the eggs, separate yolk and egg-white. Set aside.
4. Take the egg-white, add a pinch of salt and whip the whites, just a tad before the whites are about to be firm, work on the honey
5. Pour the honey in a pan and bring to a boil.
6. Incorporate the honey into the egg whites and mix well to get firm egg whites. Set aside.
7. Take the yolks, add 50 g of sugar and mix well, the yolk must become lighter.
8. Now incorporate the egg whites into the yolks, bit by bit, carefully so as to not break the whites.
9. Time to whip the cream, place the very cold cream into a bowl, add a pinch of salt and mount your cream into a chantilly (whipped cream).
10. Incorporate the whipped cream carefully into the previous batter (egg-whites)
11. Incorporate - always carefully - the nuts.
12. Time to make a choice
  1. If you have an ice cream machine, you can churn it for 10-15 minutes. The resulting Ice Nougat will be a tad stronger in flavor and get a much darker shade. After 10 minutes, transfer to a recipient and place into the freezer.
  2. Alternatively, you can transfer the batter directly into a recipient you can cover and place into the freezer. Using this method, you may need to wait about 24 h for the batter to set properly. The Ice Nougat will then be much lighter and the flavor a tad more subtle.

Note: You can serve as-is or with someÂ [Raspberry Coulis](Raspberry Coulis.md).
