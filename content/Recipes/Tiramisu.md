### Details
## Ingredients

- 200 gr of Mascapone (1 pack)
- 1 egg 
- 50 gr of sugar
- 1 Orange Zest
- 1 Lemon Zest
- Black Espresso (with spoon of sugar)
- Amaretto (Italian liquor)
- Biscuit Champagne (Italian Biscuit)/Lady Fingers

Multiply quantities as you need...usual x4 when we have people over.


## Method

1. Separate yolk and white, keep both. Set the white aside
2. Mix sugar and egg  until it gets creamy
3. Mix-in the mascapone
4. Add the lemon and orange zests
5. Mix the whites "en neige", make sure they get nice and hard
6. Incorporate carefully the white(s) to the yolk-sugar mix
7. Pour 1 espresso, add some sugar and a splash of Amaretto (like 1/4 Tbsp)
8. Place the biscuit at the bottom of a plate (with high sides)
9. Pour the espresso onto the biscuits (get them wet...but not too much)
10. Pour the mix onto the biscuits
11. Place in the fridge
12. Before serving, lightly sprinkle some cocoa powder onto the top of the dessert. I do this using a small mesh strainer.
13. An couple of hours in the fridge is fine....but 8-12 hours is better and a full day just perfect.
