### Details
**Ingredients**

- 1 Duck Breast
- 1 Twig of Thyme
- Salt & Pepper
- Optional: Duck Fat


**Method**

1. Heat the water to 67 °C
2. Dry the duck breat
3. Salt & Pepper
4. Add the twig of thyme
5. Vacuum and seal the bag
6. Place into the hot bath for 35 mn
7. Place a pan to heat up with a tad of duck fat - medium heat (use butter if you do not have duck fat)
8. Sauté the breat for 60 seconds or so on each side

**Note**: As I have a single circulator and bath, I prep the veggies ahead of time, after they are cooked, I chill the bag into ice water then store in the fridge. When the meat is ready, I take the bag out, and immerse it a couple minute into the hot bath, then sauté the veggies
