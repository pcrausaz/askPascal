### Details
**Ingredients**

- 1 bunch of asparagus (about 1 lb/450gr)
- 12 shrimps
- 250 gr of Spaghetti
- 1 shallot
- 1 garlic clove
- Some butter
- Some chicken or veggie stock
- Some cashew milk
- 1 lemon
- Salt & pepper


**Method**

1. The key to the recipe is to reuse the same water for the asparagus, shrimp and pasta
2. Boil some water
3. Salt in the boiling water
4. Clean the asparagus, place them in the boiling water for 2 minutes
5. Scoop out the asparagus (remember, we want to keep the water), and place them in an ice bath
6. Dry then out, and but in half vertically then in length (angled cut, instead of straigh)
7. In the same boiling water pot, add the shrimp
8. My shrimp were frozen, and threw them in the water for about 4 mn, if the shrimp are not frozen, 2-3 mn should be enough
9. Take out the shrimp - keep the water -,plunge them in an ice bath, then remove the shell, cut to bite size and set aside
10. Now cook the pasta as per your package direction (10 mn for me ) minus 2 minutes (so 8 mn for me).
11. Time to prep a skillet, on medium heat with a bit of butter or olive oil
12. Add the minced shallot
13. Add the minced garlic
14. Add 1/2 cup of boiling water (from the pasta pot)
15. Add 1/2 of cashew milk  
16. Take the pasta out of the water pot and add to the skillet, add some more pasta water  in the skillet if needed
17. Add the asparagus, shrimp, a pinch of lemon juice and stir until the pasta is cooked and the ingredients are warm. Adjust salt and pepper as needed, as well as the water (you want a bit of sauce, use the pasta water as needed).
