### Details
## Ingredients

- 600 gr (1.25 cup) of Carrots
- 60 gr (4 Tbsp) of unsalted butter
- 30 gr (2 Tbsp) of sugar
- Salt


## Method

1. Peel the carrots and cut in rounds, about 3 mm thick
2. Place the carrots in a large pot
3. Add 50 cl of water (2 cups) which should just cover it, if it does not add a tad more
4. Add a pinch of salt, the butter and the sugar
5. Optional: To ensure the carrots cooks gently without coloring, cut a circle of parchment paper, pick it with a fork a few time, then place it over the carrots
6. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 25 mn over medium heat. Use a cover if you did not use the parchment paper
7. Remove the parchment paper if you used it
8. Cook for another 5 minutes, uncovered
9. At that point the water should be all gone and the carrots cooked, tender and glossy with butter and sugar.

**Notes**: If you add more water, add proportionally more sugar. In my experience go light on the water, less tends to be better.
