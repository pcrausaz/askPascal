> A nice recipe to make this traditional south of france dish. Traditionally made in a copper pan, it still works well with any plate - I use a roasting pan - you can place in your oven.

### Details
## Ingredients 

- 125g Chickpeas Flour
- ~250ml of water
  - Play it by feel here, the socca should be of the consistency of a pate a [Crepe](/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=miam&title=Crepe&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=359137343).
- Olive Oil (3-4 Tbsp + 3-4 Tbsp for the pan)
- 1 Tsp Salt 
- Black Pepper


## Method

1. Pre-heat oven at the max temperature (mine is 550 °F)
2. Mix flour, salt and olive oil, mix in the water
3. Make sure there is no lumps in the dough and it is smooth
4. Oil the pan, about 2-3 mm of oil in the pan
5. Place the pan in the oven, preferably toward the top racks
6. Cook for about 3 mns
7. Turn on the oven grill for another 5-6 mns
8. If large bubbles form, just break them
9. Keep a close eye to ensure the socca does not over-cook
10. Take the pan out, break the socca in square, and crack black pepper over the socca and serve.

  

Perfect with a nice salad or just as-is.
