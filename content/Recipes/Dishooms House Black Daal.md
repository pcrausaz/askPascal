### Details
## Ingredients

- 300 g of whole (black) urad daal
- 12 g of garlic
- 10 g of ginger
- Some Oil
- 70 g of tomato puree
- 8 g of salt
- 2/3 tsp of deggi mirch chili powder
- 1/3 tsp of garam masala
- 90 g of butter
- 90 ml of double cream


## Method

1. Place the daal in a large bowl and cover with water. Whisk it for a 10 s, let the daal settle and pour the water out. Repeat 3 or 4 times until the water is clear
2. In a large cast iron,  add the daal, then add 3-4 liters of water. 
3. Bring to a boil and cook it - going fairly strong - for 3-4 hours
4. Skim any impurities that rise to the top and add water (boiling) as required to cover the daal
  1. It is supposed to be cooked when you press the grain starts to come away from the skin and become creamy
5. In a shredder, mix the garlic, ginger with a bit of oil, add the tomato puree, the salt, the chili powder and the garam masala to a paste
6. Carefully pour the daal out of the cooking water (throw way the cooing water) then add some 'clean' boiling water over the daal to cover it (3-4 cm), bring to a boil then keep at medium-high, and add the paste and the butter
7. Cook for about 30 minutes, stir frequently to avoid sticking
8. Now lower the heat and simmer for about 60-90 mn, add water (boiling) as needed to keep at the grain level
9. It should become creamy
10. Add the cream, then cook for another 15 mn
