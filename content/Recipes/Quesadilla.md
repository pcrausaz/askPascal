### Details
## Ingredients

- 2 Tomatoes
- 2 Avocados
- 1 pack of Guacamole Mix
- 1 Lemon
- 1 bundle of scallion (fresh green onions)
- 1 jalapeno hot pepper
- 4 cups of mexican shredded cheese mix
- 8 Large flour tortillas
- Salt & Pepper


## Method

1. Finely cut the tomatoes (2-3 mm)
2. Finely slice the scallions
3. Finaly cut the jalapeno
4. Prep the guacamole (Avocado, Guacamole Mix + half of the lemon juiced mashed up together)
5. In a bowl mix the scallion, jalapeno and tomatoes
6. Weight the mix and distribute in 4 parts
7. Place a non stick pan on medium heat, wait a couple of minutes for the pan to get to temperature
8. Place 1 tortilla in the pan
9. Add 1 cup of cheese on the tortilla
10. Now distribute evenly 1 part of your scallion, tomato & jalapeno mix on the tortilla
11. Add salt & black pepper to taste
12. While it cooks, lay another tortilla on a plate
13. Now spread 1/4th of your guacamole mix on that tortilla
14. Go back check your cooking tortilla, if the cheese is melted, it is about to be ready for the next phase
15. Now turn over your second tortilla (one with the guacamole) with the guacamole face down so that it lays on top of the cheese/tomato mix over the one in the pan.
16. Place your empty plate on top the two tortilla and use it to flip the tortilla so as to cook the other side of the tortilla
17. Wait a couple of minutes and it should be ready to serve
18. Repeat for the 3 remaining tortilla

**Note**: keep a close eye on your tortilla so that they do not burn. Better to go slow if you are not sure, turn down the heat if necessary.
