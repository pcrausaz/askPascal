### Details
**Ingredients**

- 1/4 Cup of Mirin
- 1/4 Cup of Sake
- 1/3 Cup of Miso paste
- 1/3 Cup of Sugar
- 1 lb to 1.5 lb of cod (deboned)


**Method**

1. Boil the mirin and sake for 3 minutes
2. Reduce the heat, add the sugar and miso paste
3. Cook for another 2-3 minutes
4. Let the marinade cool down
5. Once cool, pour over the fish, cover it - preferably tightly - and marinate for 24 to 48 hours (I did 24 hours the first time and it was a success. Do I need to mention you need to place it in the fridge while marinating?
6. I broiled it in the air fryer at 375 F for about 12-15 mn keeping an eye on it. I turned over the fish mid-time.
