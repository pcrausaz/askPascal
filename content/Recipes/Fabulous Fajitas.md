**Method**

### Method Marinade

1. Mix all the marinade ingredients together
2. Add black pepper on meat(press with hand palm to make it go into)
3. Put meat and marinade into a large zip bag. Let it rest 8-24 hours (less is ok if time press: first time I tried 1 hour and it was fine).

### Method Meal

1. Mince the Bell peppers, onions
2. Prepare the guacamole
3. Pour Salsa and Sour cream in bowls
4. Pre-heat the flour tortilla for 1 minute in microwave
5. Turn on the oven on the warm setting (just keep the meat warm after)
6. Drain the marinade (keep set aside the left over juices) and dry the meat.
7. Heat some oil - medium heat - in a large pan
8. Cook the steak for about 2 minutes on each side
9. Set the meat aside in the warm oven
10. Set the pan on medium-heat, add a tad of oil (and butter)
11. Toss in the sliced onions and peppers and cook for a few minutes.
12. Then toss in a bit of the marinade and continue cooking until ready (at the end I usually grab the juice from the meat and throw it in as well).
13. 1 more minute on the flour tortillas and at the same time (microwave)
14. Get the meat out and slice the meat in thin slices, making sure to cut across the grain, slightly in diagonal, inner-length strips.

**Note**Â : 3 ounces steak per tortilla, 2 tortillas per person = 6 ounces total each person 6 ounces x 6 people = 36 ounces = 2 1/4 pounds steak ...1 ounce = 30 gr,) To eat, each one roll his/her own, a flour tortilla, some guacamole, some meat, some fried onions+pepper, salsa and sour cream.
