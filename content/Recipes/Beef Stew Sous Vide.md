### Details
**Ingredients Sous-Vide**

- 2 Lb of Beef Chuck Roast 
- 2 Tsp of Garlic Powder
- 2 Tbsp of olive oil
- Kosher Salt
- Black Pepper
- Optional: 1 Tsp of Piment d'Espelette 


**Ingredients Stew**

- 1 Onion
- 4-5 Cloves of garlic
- 4-5 Button Mushrooms
- 2 Carrots
- 2 Tbsp of Flour
- Kosher Salt
- Black Pepper
- 1 Cup of White Wine
- 1 Cup of Red Wine
- 1 Cup of Beef Stock or Water
- Juices from the Sous-Vide meat
- 2 Tbsp of Parsley
- 2 Tbsp of olive oil
- 2 bay leaves


**Method Meat Sous-Vide**

1. Heat the water bath to 34 °F/56.5 °C
2. Cut the meat into 1 in (2.5 cm) chunks
3. Season with salt, black pepper, garlic powder & piment d'Espelette
4. Lay the meat into 1 or 2 Quart Heat-seal storage bag on 1 layer and seal
5. When the water reach the proper temp, lay the back into the tank and cook for 48 hours.
  1. My first try was with 24 h, the meat was good, but still chewy, hence the 48 hours.


**Method Stew**

1. About 90 minutes before you want to eat, you need to start the stew, the meat should have been cooked already.
2. Dice the onion and the carrot
3. Peel the garlic cloves
4. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil over medium heat in a cast iron pan, sauté onions and carrots for a few minutes until the onions become translucent, then set aside
5. Open the meat pouches, making sure to reserve the juices
6. Dry the meat, then sprinkle with the flour
7. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil over medium heat and sauté the meat for a few minutes until the meat browns
8. Cool the meat (place in a bowl then set the bowl in ice water). Once cool, set the meat aside in the fridge
9. Add the water, wine & juices into the pan, scratching the bottom to detach all the good stuff
10. Add back the onions and carrots
11. Add the bay leaves
12. Salt and pepper to taste
13. Let this simmer and reduce roughly 2/3 or until the sauce thicken. If you timing/heat is off and you do not have enough liquid, add back some water.
14. About 5 minutes before serving, add the meat back to re-heat
15. Lastly sprinkle the minced parsley and serve

Works well with boiled potatoes, mash potatoes or pasta.
