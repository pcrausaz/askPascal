### Details
## Ingredients

- 8-10 Small Artichokes
- Lemon
- 1-2 Garlic clove
- Salt & Pepper
- OLive Oil


## Method

1. Pre-heat oven at 375 °F 
2. Prepare a bowl of cold water, add the juice of 1 lemon. This will be used to keep the hearts from browning while you prepare them.
3. Cut the Artichokes on all side to remove all the 'tough' leaves and the bottom. I do one cut per side which transform the artichoke into a little rectangle, once cut, submerge immediately into the lemon-water
4. Cut the garlic very small.
5. Drain the artichoke, place in a bowl. 
6. Add the garlic, slat and pepper to taste and about 2 Tbsp of Olive Oil
7. Place on a roasting pan and into the oven for about 45 minutes
8. Shake from time to time
