### Details
**Ingredients**

- 6 heads of baby bok choy
- 2 in of fresh ginger
- 3 cloves of garlic
- Olive Oil (Kinch uses sunflower oil)
- 0.5 cup of low sodium soy sauce


**Method**

1. Peel the ginger and finely dice
2. Peel the garlic and finely chop (hehe dice vs chop, good luck)
3. Clean the bok choy, remove the outer eaves if they look hard, trim a bit of the bottom (careful of they will come apart if you cut too much), then slice in two, lengthwise
4. In a pan, heat the oil on medium heat
5. When the oil is hot, add the bok choy, cut side down
6. Cook for 5 mn, so that they caramelize a bit, move then gently from time to time so that they do not stick
7. Reduce the heat to low, add the ginger, garlic and soy sauce. Stir a bit to combine, then cover and cook for about 5 minutes
8. Remove the bok choy and set aside
9. With the heat still on low, add the salmon, skin side down, cover and cook for 5 mn
10. Uncover, baste the salmon with the soy sauce
11. Return the bok choy to the pan
12. Cover and cook another 5 mn or until the salmon is cooked through
13. Take out and serve

  

We tried with Salmon, Halibut and even chicken. Works with all of them....but salmon is the best fit.
