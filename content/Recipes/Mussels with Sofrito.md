## Variation (or leftovers)

The first time I did this recipe, we had plenty of mussels and broth left over. Here is what I did and it turn out awesome

1. Follow the recipe above. Take the meat of the mussels and set aside
2. Set the broth aside
3. Refrigerate mussels and broth once they are at room temperature (safer to try to bring them at room temperature quickly using an ice bath of some sort - don't add water to the mussel or the broth, but you can 'bain marie' it with the ice bath.
4. 30 minutes before serving place the mussels and broth into the freezer
5. At the time of serving, place some cold mussels into a bowl, add the cold broth, then add some shredded basil leaves. Serve.

This last one is perfect for hot summer days, sort of a mussels based [Gazpacho](Gazpacho.md).
