### Details
**Ingredients**

- 1-2 cup of granulated sugar
- 1 pinch of salt
- 2 sheets of puff pastry (defrosted)
- Parchment paper
- Baking pan


**Method**

1. Pre-heat oven to 450 F
2. Combine sugar and salt & mix
3. Pour 1/2 cup of the sugar mix onto a flat surface
4. Unfold a sheet of dough on top of it
5. Pour 1/2 cup of the sugar mix on top of the dough
6. Spread the sugar evenly over the dough
7. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough slightly to press the sugar into the dough
8. here comes the tricky part, you want to fold the dough so that you end up with 6 layers, so fold the side of the square towards the middle so that it goes 1/2 over the middle, then fold again so that it meets the middle
9. Fold one more time. You should have now 6 layers.
10. Give it a light roll using the rolling pin
11. With a knife, now slice the dough into 3/8 inches slices
12. Place the slices, cut side, over a baking pan, lined with parchment paper, keep them slightly apart so they can expand.
13. You can sprinkle some more sugar on top
14. Place the pan into the oven for about 6 minutes, they should now be caramelized on the bottom
15. Turn each palmier over (using a couple of spatula) and bake for another 5 minutes
16. Take out to a cooling rack once they are done
