### Details
**Ingredients**

- 500 gr of Black Cherries (frozen ok but fresh are better)
- 5 Eggs
- 120 gr of Sugar
- 70 gr of Flour
- 250 ml of heavy cream
- 1 pack of Vanilla Sugar (optional, about 9 gr)
- 1-2 pinch of salt
- 1 Tsp of baking soda
- 25 gr of butter (for the plate)


**Method**

1. Pit the cherries. If using frozen cherries,
2. Thaw the cherries, dry them out as much as you can. The traditional recipe uses fresh un-pitted cherries...but that is such a pain to eat that I recommend either frozen cherries or pitted fresh black cherries
3. Pre-heat the oven at 350F
4. Butter your plate (rectangular pyrex or pie pan; wide enough so that the Clafoutis is not too tall 1/2-3/4 of inch Clafoutis is perfect) then flour the plate
5. Place the cherries into the plate, set aside
6. Sift the flour
7. Add the sugar, baking soda, the pinch of salt and vanilla sugar. 
8. Mix well.
9. Add the eggs, one by one, while mixing.
10. While mixing, add the cream
11. Pour the mix into the plate over the cherries
12. Place into the oven and bake for about 40 minutes.

**Note**: When done, let the Clafoutis cool a bit, you can sprinkle a little bit of cassonade or brown sugar on top.
