### Details
**Ingredients**

- 1 Kg of beef (any stew variety, gite, giguilette macreuse, jumeau etc)
- 1 Tbsp of oil (I use olive)
- 50 g Butter
- 1 Carrot
- 2 Onions
- Some flour (2-3 Tbsp or so)
- 1-2 Bottle of red wine (corse/not too light, but take a good wine)
- A small stab of bacon or 2-3 "thick" strips of bacon
- Salt & Pepper
- 1 Glass of water or better some beef or veggie broth
- 1 tsp of tomato paste
- 2 Garlic cloves
- Bouquet garni
- 1 kg of potatoes
- Fresh Chopped Parsley


**Method**

1. Cut the meet in chunks, just the right size (2x3 cm or so, according to your taste).
2. In a large thick pot (cocotte), eat some oil (olive) then the meat, the idea is to brown the meat, just a few minutes will do. Take the meat out, mix in the flour with the meat. Put the bacon into the pot, then throw in the bacon cut in pieces (small), let the bacon sweat a bit. Put the butter into the pot, add in the carrots and the onions sliced (both).
3. Add back the meat, mixed on high heat, let the flour color a bit.
4. Add the red wine, salt, pepper, tomato paste, bouquet garni, garlic and broth or water, bring to a boil then reduce heat and cook 2 hours or so.
5. 30 minutes before the end cook the potatoes (if possible above the meat).
6. Serve directly in the pot. I find it best with boiled potatoes that I simply roughly crush in the plate, then I lay out the stew on top

**Note**Â marinate the meat a night before with red wine and some aromats (bouquet garnit, ail, oigon + olive oil etc...). Dry the meat before use, and replace some of the wine by the marinade when cooking.

**Margo's note:** If you want to try an untraditional venison, this recipe also works wonderfully with version in place of beef. I used venison haunch and it was delicious.
