### Details
**Ingredients**

- 500g of Potatoes
- 400g of Leeks
- 100g of bacon
- 25 cl of Milk
- 70 g of butter
- 100 g of Swiss Gruyere
- 4 table spoon of flour ('a ras')
- Nutmeg, Salt, Pepper


**Method**

1. Pre-heat oven at 180 C. (about 350 F).
2. Clean up the leeks, then slice in rounds.
3. In a pan, cook the leeks at low heat with about 15g of butter, ensure they do not color and cover them for about 10 minutes. Put aside.
4. Grate the cheese
5. Slice the bacon in little pieces.
6. Saute the bacon in a pan so that it becomes crispy (remove the oil when needed). Dry the oil from the bacon once it is cooked as well.Put aside.
7. Slice the potatoes.Put aside.
8. In a small sauce pot, heat the butter (medium-low), then incorporate the flour (bit by bit), then add a tad of milk mixing well and continue slowly to add up all the milk..always stirring. Bring slowly to a boil in order to obtain a 'fluid' Bechamel.
9. Now is the time to build your gratin.
10. In a large pan, layout one layer of potatoes, one layer of leeks, bacon, grated cheese, pepper, pour some bechamel on top, then another layer of potatoes, leeks, bacon, cheese, pepper and bechamel, top with a few slices of potatoes and the rest of the bechamel. Salt and pepper. I top it all with a bit of cream (100 mg or so).
11. Cover the pan with an aluminium foil, put into the oven for about 1 hour.
12. After 1 hours, check that the potatoes are cooked, if not, add a few minutes. Once the potatoes are cooked, remove the foil, turn up the hear to 400-425 to get the final 'gratin' on the top. # # # Serve as soon as it is out of the oven.

**Note**: Goes very well with a nice steak.
