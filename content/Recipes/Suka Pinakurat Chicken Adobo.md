### Details
**Ingredients**

- 1+ lb of chicken thighs, skin on
- 10 large garlic cloves, slices in long slivers
- 1 tbsp of fresh cracked black pepper
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tbsp of grated ginger (fresh)
- 75 ml [suka pinakurat](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R629YWX) (coconut vinegar)
- 125 ml of white vinegar
- 100 ml of dark soy sauce
- 4 tbsp of dark brown sugar
- Bunch of coriander
- 1 red chili (i used 2 small thai chili)
- Olive Oil


**Method**

1. If using skin-on thighs, slice the skin to the bone, about 3x to allow the sauce to penetrate deep into the meet
2. Heat the olive oil in a large wok (1-2 tbsp), then cook the chicken, skin-down, for 6-8 minutes, turning it a few time, allow the skin to brown
3. At this point, check the level of oil in the pan - the chicken may have render fat - remove a bit if you have too much, then add the slice garlic, fresh cracked black pepper, bay leaves and grated ginger. Cook on high heat for 2 minutes
4. In a small bowl mix together theÂ [suka pinakurat](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R629YWX), white vinegar, soy and sugar, then pour over the chick
5. Bring to a boil, and boil for 2 minutes deglazing the bottom of the wok
6. reduce the heat and cook for about 15-20 mn, stirring from time to time
7. Remove the lid, cook some more - about 10 mn until the sauce reduce and the chicken is cooked (if the sauce thicken too much, add a tad of water)
8. Serve on plain rice.

  

The original recipe calls for skin on, bone-in thighs...I only had skinless/boneless and it worked just fine
