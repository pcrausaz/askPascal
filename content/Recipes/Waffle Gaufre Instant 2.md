### Details
## Ingredients 

- 300 g Flour
- 2 Eggs
- 40 cl Milk
- 1 Tsp of Instant Yeast
- 1 Tsp Sugar
- 1 pinch of salt
- Neutral Oil for the waffle maker
- Various goodies to coat the cooked waffle with:
  - Powdered sugar
  - Maple Sirup
  - Strawberries
  - Nutella
  - etc...

This makes about 3 whole waffles.


## Method

1. Pre-heat the waffle maker
2. In a bowl, mix the eggs until they foam a little
  1. Note: I use my KitchenAid Stand Mixer for this recipe, works great  
3. Incorporate the rest of ingedients (flour, yeast, sugar, salt and milk) until you get something smooth. It should not be too liquid.
4. Using paper tissue (watch out it burns), very lightly oil your waffle maker grid
5. Place about a third of the preparation onto the waffle maker, careful not to place to much so that it does not spill over
6. Close the waffle maker cook for 1 minute
7. Turn over, cook for another minute
8. Server with any ingredient that suits your taste
