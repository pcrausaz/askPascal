### Details
## Ingredients

- 2 sheets of Puff Pastry
- 100 gr of unsalted butter
- 125 gr of Almond Meal (grounded almond)
- 100 gr of sugar
- 3 (2+1) eggs
- Optional: a few whole almonds


## Method

1. Pre-heat the oven at 450 F
2. Take the butter our and let it get to room temperature
3. In a bowl mix the Almond meal and the sugar, then mix with the butter
4. Add the eggs, one at at time until each egg is well incorporated into the mixture
5. Take one egg, prepare an egg wash (mix the egg with 1 tsp of milk or water)
6. On a baking sheet, lay out the first sheet of puff pastry
7. Brush the sides of the sheet with the egg wash
8. Layout the almond mixture on the sheet, keeping a couple of centimers free on each side
9. Optional: you can add the traditional 'Feve'
10. Now for the tricky part, lay out the second sheet of push pastry on top of the first, align well. With your fingers, press the sides together, then roll up the sides (toward the center - duh) to seal it well. Press again the roll with your fingers.
11. Now with a small knife, perform small cuts in the border (about 2-3 mm), every couple of centimers, using the tip of the knife.
12. Using the rest of the egg wash, 'paint' the top of the pie.
13. Optional: Using the tip of the knife, you can carefully trace some lines on top (squares, diagonals etc..) or any sketch that you fancy. Careful as not to poke through.
14. Place the pie into the oven at 450 F for 10 mn
15. Now reduce the heat down to 350 F and cook for another 20 mn
