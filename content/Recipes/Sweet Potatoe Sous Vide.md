### Details
## Ingredients

- 4-5 Sweet Potatoes
- 1 Tbsp of unsalted Butter
- Salt & Pepper
- 0.5 Tbsp of unsalted Butter to sauté the veggies


## Method

1. Peel and cut in half the Sweet Potatoes
2. Place the veggies into the bag
3. Add the butter
4. Salt and pepper
5. Vacuum and seal the bag
6. Place into the hot bath for 45 mn
7. Place a pan to heat up with a tad of oil
8. Take out the veggies
9. Add butter to the pan and sauté the veggies for a couple of minutes

**Note**: As I have a single circulator and bath, I prep the veggies ahead of time, after they are cooked, I chill the bag into ice water then store in the fridge. When the meat is ready, I take the bag out, and immerse it 1 minute into the hot bath, then sauté the veggies
