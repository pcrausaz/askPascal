### Details
**Ingredients**

- 1 Lb of Shrimp
- 1 Tbsp of Green Curry paste
- 1 Tbsp of Red Curry paste
- 1 Can of Coconut milk
- 1 Clove of garlic (2 if you are using unpeeled shrimp)
- 1 inch of fresh ginger root
- 1 Tsp of tomato paste
- 1/2 Tsp of curry powder
- Cilantro
- Olive Oil


**Method**

1. Clean and slice some of the fresh cilantro; set aside
2. Peel and cut the ginger in small bits, do the same with the garlic
3. In a spice mortar, grind the ginger and garlic to form a paste
4. If you using unpeeled shrimp, in a pan, peel the second garlic clove, cut in small bits, heat some olive oil at medium heat then saute the shrimp with the garlic and a pinch of salt for a couple of minutes. We just want to make the shrimp easier to peel.
5. Take the shrimp off the heat and set aside to cool for a few minutes
6. Peel the shrimp (keep the juices and garlic)
7. Now in a cast iron pan, at medium-low, heat the curry paste with the ginger and garlic paste. When the mixture start to perfume your kitchen add the tomato paste
8. Pour in a bit of coconut milk to dilute the mixture, then add the rest of the coconut milk
9. Bring all to a simmer then add the shrimps
10. Let the shrimp cook for a few minutes (never overcook the shrimp they tend to get chewy), a 3-4 minutes at medium-low heat should do.
11. Take of the heat and mix in the cilantro

Serve with some Jasmin rice. You can use frozen shrimps but do not use pre-cooked shrimp as they tend to become hard and chewy.
