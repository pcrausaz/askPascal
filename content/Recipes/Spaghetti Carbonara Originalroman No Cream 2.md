### Details
## Ingredients

- ~150g of pasta per person, preferably spaghetti
- 50g-60g of Guancale or pancetta
- 50g-60g of Pecorino cheese or parmesan
- 2 eggs (1 egg per portion + 1 egg)
- Fresh black pepper


## Method

1. Bring your water to boil
2. Usually done with dry pasta, but worked well with fresh one as well, just make sure to under cook it. The one I used required 5 mn cooking, I went to 3 mn
3. Cut the Guancale in small bit
4. Grate the cheese
5. In a pan, add the guancale, then medium heat and cook the meat to render the fat. If needed add a tiny bit of oil (especially if using pancetta)
6. In a bowl, add the eggs (all the egg, yolk and white), and mix
7. Add the grated cheese to the eggs
8. Add fresh black pepper to the egg/cheese mix and mix
9. Lower the heat under the guancale
10. Once the pasta need 3 mn more of cooking, transfer the pasta to the pan to medium low
11. Add a little bit ( 3/4 ladle) of pasta water to the pan, mix (don't break the pasta)
12. Add 1 ladle of pasta water to the egg/pecorino mix, mix well
13. Turn the heat back to low
14. Add the egg/pecorino cheese mix to the pasta
15. Quickly mix
16. Wait for the sauce to become creamy, about a couple of minutes
17. Turn off the heat
18. Right away plate and serve
19. Once the pasta is in the plate, add some fresh black pepper and some grated pecorino (optional)
