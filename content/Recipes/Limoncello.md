### Details
**Ingredients**

- 5 limes
- 2 lime leaves
- 600 gr of Sugar
- 1 l. of 90% Alcohol (or 75.5% in CA, 151 Proof)
- 1 l. of water
- 1 glass bottle


**Method**

1. Prepare the lime zests, I use a vegetable peeler (econome), then I scrap the white stuff using an utility knife. Make sure none stick to the zest, it would give the preparation a bitter taste.
2. Cut the zests in 3-4 mm strips
3. Place the zest into the Alcohol and pour into a glass container you can close. On trick I use, is to use 50% of the final container, so that I can use the final container for that phase.
4. Let it infuse for about 24 hours
5. The day after, boil the water, once it boils take of the heat, mix in the sugar and the lime leaves
6. Let the water cool down
7. Mix the alcohol, zest and water
8. Take out the zest, quickly after mixing alcohol and water. It is useful to keep some of the sugared water to rince the zests.
9. Filter the liquid (use a fine cloth) and pour the liquor into a bottle.
10. Place the bottle into the freezer
