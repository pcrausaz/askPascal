### Details
## Ingredients

- 4.5 cup of rolled oats (not instant)
- 1.5 cup of raw almonds, chopped
- 0,25 cup of sunflower seeds
- 0.25 cup of pepitas
- 0.5 cup cranberries
- 0.5 cup raisins
- 1 or 2 Tsp of cinnamon
- 0.33 cup of canola oil
- 1.25 cup dark amber maple sirup


## Method

1. Pre-heat oven to 325 F
2. In a large bow mix all the ingredients but the cranberries and raisins
3. Once the oven is warm, spread the granola on a large pan lined with parchment paper
4. Bake the granola for 25 minutes, stirring halfway
5. Repeat: Stir and continue baking for another 5 minutes, but from now on keep a close eye on it as it is close to the point where it can burn. Depending on your oven you may need to roast it a bit more. If necessary Â continue to cook in increments of 5 minutes until the granola is roasted to perfection. I recommend to stir every time you check it. Overall it can take another 20-25 mn, so for a total time of about 40 mn.
6. Take out of the oven
7. Mix in the cranberries and raisins
  1. As I like my cranberries roasted, I tend to add them as part of step #2

**Note**: Perfect served with some plain yogourt.
