### Details
## Ingredients

- 3/4 cup fresh lime juice
- 1/2 cup sugar, a tad more for rimming the glasses
- 1 (16-ounce) package frozen mango cubes
- 2/3 cup rum
- 1/3 cup orange liqueur (recommended: Cointreau, but triple-sec will work)
- 4 cups ice cubes
- Lime slices, for garnish


## Method

1. In a glass (non-reactive) bowl stir together the lime juice and sugar until sugar is completely dissolved, to make a lime syrup.
2. Wet the rims of serving glasses with water and dip in sugar, set aside.
3. Combine the lime syrup and all remaining ingredients in a blender and process on high speed until completely smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.

Serve in sugared glasses, garnished with lime slices.
