### Details
## Ingredients

- 3 pounds flank steak
- 1 white onion, chopped
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 Jalapeno Pepper
- 1 Tsp of Chili power
- 1 Tsp of ground Cumin> [!NOTE]
> - Salt\* Pepper
- 1 lime, juiced
- 12+ small corn flour tortillas (about 10 cm diameter)


## Method

1. Chop the onions, the jalapenos and the cilantro, add the juice of 1 lime; mix well.
2. Take the meat out of the bag, then slice is small strips (about 1cm by 1 cm)
3. Place a pan over low heat, and heat up the tortillas; you can also do this in the oven (a few mn or so on warm)
4. Place a skillet over medium-high heat, a dash of olive oil, add the pieces of meat. Add the chili powder and the cumin. Cook, always stirring until the meat is cooks to your taste (about 5 mn).
5. Now build your tacos, on each plate (this will make about 12 tortillas), lay a couple of tortillas, add some meat, then add the mixture of onions, jalapenos and lime.

**Note**: Margo does not take cilantro and lime. Nan all but lime. Some add salsa on top of it, but I do not find it necessary.
