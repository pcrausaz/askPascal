### Details
**Ingredients**

- 3-4 large potatoes
- 1 Cup of cream
- 1 Cup of mlik
- 4-5 Garlic cloves
- 1-2 Laurel leaves
- Some Gruyere cheese
- Salt & pepper
- Butter
- Parchment paper


**Method**

1. Pre-heat the oven at 325-350Â°F
2. In a pan, add milk, cream, laurel, garlic, light salt and pepper, bring to a boil, then turn the heat off and set aside for 15-20 mn
3. Peel the potatoes, then slide - using a [mandoline](https://www.amazon.com/Benriner-BN-64W-benrina/dp/B01D2C09LW), very thin, almost paper thin.
4. In a rectangular - oven safe - plate, lay some parchment paper to cover the bottom and the sides. This will make it easier to take the gratin out (un-mold) on the last step.
5. Lay down one layer of potatoes, salt and pepper, add some of the milk & cream mixture., then a little bit of cheese...then repeat until you have no more potatoes
6. Cover with an aluminum foil
7. Place into the oven for 3 hours, if your oven is like mine, I rotate the plate every 45 mn to ensure front and back get the same amount of heat
8. Verify from time to time that it does not burn.
9. Take the plate out and let it cool down
10. Once the plate is cool down, place a board on the top of the foil and add some weight. The idea is to compress the potatoes slightly while they are in the refrigerator. Place the plate into the fridge.
11. The day after, about 20 mn before serving, pre-heat a pan
12. Take the gratin out of the fridge, turn over a board to un-mold it (it helps to use a knife on the sides), then slice 1-2 inches sections of the gratin, cleaning up the ends with the knife.
13. Add 50 g of buter (or more) into the pan, until it starts to foam
14. Place the gratin into the foaming butter, then baste, do this for about 2 mn per sides, turning your gratin rectangles every 2 minutes
15. Take out onto a paper towel to absorb the excess butter, then plate to serve.
