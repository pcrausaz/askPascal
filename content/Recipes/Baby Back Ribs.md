### Details
## Ingredients

- 1 Rack of Baby back ribs
- 1 Tbsp of cracked Pepperr
- 1 Tbsp of kosher salt
- 1/2 Tbsp of Paprika
- 1/2 Tbsp of Ground Mustard Seeds
- 1/4 Tsp of Cayenne Pepper
- Optional: your favorite bbq sauce (personally I skip this)
- Aluminium foil


## Method

1. Make sure to remove the inner skin of your ribs if your butcher has not done it yet as it makes for chewing bits if you do not
2. Cut the Rack in two
3. Mix all the spices
4. Rub the ribs with the spices
5. Wrap each half rib rack in two layers of aluminum foil
6. Place the rack into a 350 F oven for about two hours (90 mms works was well if you are in a hurry)
7. When the ribs are about ready, pre-heat your BQQ on medium-high
8. When the ribs are done, un-wrap while carefully recover the juices - Optional: if you are going to use BBQ sauce, mix the juices with theBBQ sauce, and rub the ribs
9. Place the rib on the BBQ town down for 4 minutes
10. Turn the ribs and cook for another 4 minutes
11. Turn one last time for 4 more minutes (Total on the bbq is about 10-12 minutes)
12. Remove the ribs from the BBQ
13. Cut the ribs and serve, add more BBQ sauce if this is your thing

You may need to cook a tad more on the BBQ if you use sauce.
