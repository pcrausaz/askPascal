### Details
**Ingredients for 1 kg of dough**

- 400 g of flour
- 100 g of almond flour
- 300 g of unsalted butter
- 150 g of sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 yolk
- Pinch of salt


**Method**

1. Cut the butter in piece, then add flour, almond flour, sugar, salt and butter to the mixer
2. Mix using the dough hook till it gets to a small granulated consistency (semolina-like)
3. At this point, add the whole egg and the yolk, from now on mix only what is necessary to get the dough together
4. Wrap in plastic wrap, then place into the fridge for at least a couple of hours, 4 hours is better.

  

Note: I cook this at 250℃/ 480℉ 

  

Add a creme patissiere, mix some sugar, mascarpone cream and heavy cream, add some berries and you get a nice tartelette.
