18. Cook for 8 mn
19. Add the spinach (now, if you have it) and cook for another two minutes

  

Serve with Rice.

You may have notice the grilled salmon skin in the picture. To do it, I simply place a skillet on the stove, a tiny bit of oil, place the salmon skin down, place a glass container on top of it (to keep the skin from folding over itself) then turn the hear to low. I start this when I start the curry, turning the skin over mid-way.
