> Inspired by Conticini's Baka ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poQDZ6YwP-0)), I went to town trying to figure this one out. First try is below...more to come, most likely. Based on a babka dough by Jeffrey Cagnes.

### Details
## Ingredients Dough

- 250 g of flour
- 3 g of salt
- 30 g of sugar
- 12 g of fresh yeast
- 150 g of lukewarm milk
- 50 g of unsalted butter, softened


## Ingredients Praline

- 150 g of hazelnuts
- 150 g of almonds
- 200 g of sugar
- 50 g of water


## Ingredients Sirup

- 50 g of sugar
- 60 g of water


## Method Dough

1. Cut the butter in small pieces, let it soften to room temperature
2. In the kitchen aid bowl, add salt, flour, yeast, sugar and lukewarm milk
3. Mix.- using the dough hook - at low speed until he dough comes together (dough hook did not work well for me, so moved to the scrapper) for about 8 minutes until the dough comes off the side of the bowl
4. Add the butter piece by piece until well incorporated.
5. Dough should be smooth and elastic.
6. Place the bowl in a clear bowl, plastic wrap to contact, then in the fridge.
7. Set the dough aside and let it rest in the fridge for at least an hour or overnight


## Method Praline

1. Set the over at 300F/180C and pre-heat
2. Place hazelnuts and almond on a sheet pan, place in oven for 20 minutes, mix once or twice. This will road the nuts (can do this in the pan as well.
3. Once the nuts are roated, in a pan (high walls), add the water and sugar and bring to a boil, ideally let it reach 118C
4. Add the nuts, reduce heat to medium/medium high
5. Mix well
6. Keep mixing for 20 minutes
  1. the nuts will first turn white then caramelize
7. Once this is done, lay the nuts on a piece of parchment paper, and let it cool. Make sure the nuts are flat and not bunch together
8. Optional: set aside 30 g for the final decoration
9. Once it is cool, add to the food processor and grind to a paste
10. Store, air tight and at room temperature

  


## Method Sirup

1. Do this while the dough is baking
2. Add sugar and water to a pan
3. Bring to a boil until the sugar is well melted
4. Set aside


## Method Assembly

1. Take the dough out
2. Lightly flour your work surface
3. Roll he dough to a large rectangle, dough should be about 3-4 mm, and the rentable something like 50 cm over 25...size is not that critical
4. Once your dough rectangle is ready, spread the Praline over the surface of the rectangle
5. Optional: You can sprinkle some crushed roasted nuts (50g or so)
6. Now, roll the dough into a cylinder
7. Then cut the cylinder in 4-5 cm pieces (2 in)
8. On a sheet pan, cover with a silk pat or parchment paper
9. Place your high wall circles and place a few dough cylinder in each
10. Let this proof for an hour
11. Pre-heat your oven at 180C/350F
12. Once the dough has proofed, place in the oven for 15-20 mn
13. Take out, let it cool for 5-10 minutes
14. Prepare your sirup
15. Un-mold the babka
16. Brush the babka with the sirup
17. Add some very roughly rcushed praline  on top (the 30 g you had set aside, if you forgot, just make some more 30g should be plenty.

  

Continici add some salted caramel, likely a good thing to do....maybe next time.
