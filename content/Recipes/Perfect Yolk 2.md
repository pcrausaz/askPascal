### Details
## Ingredients

- 1 Yolk
- 250 ml of vegetable oil


## Method

1. It is easier to do in a small metal container that you will place into your water bath.
2. Add some neutral oil into the metal container, pre-heat into your sous-vide bath
3. Carefully separate the yolk from the white and place the yolk into the oil bath. Be sure the yolk is intact, otherwise it will just run down in the oil bath. Try to remove all the white as it will look nicer. If you do not have a metal container, use a zip lock bag.
4. Stir from time to time

Note: Use large paperclips to hold the container on the side of your water bath.
