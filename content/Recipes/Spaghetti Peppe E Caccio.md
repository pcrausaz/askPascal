### Details
**Ingredients**

- 125 g of spaghetti
- 60 g of pecorino romano 
- Salt
- Freshly cracked black pepper


**Method**

1. Bring some water to a boil, use 50% the water of what you use usually 
2. Grate the cheese
3. Generously salt the water once it boils
4. Add the pasta, you will cook it 70% of the time in boiling water (for me, my pasta requires 10 m for al dente, cook it for 7 m in the water)
5. In a skillet, crack some fresh pepper, be generous
6. Roast the pepper to medium heat
7. Add a ladle of pasta water to the pan
8. Add 1.4 of the ladle of pasta water to the grated cheese, just enough to bring the cheese into some sort of ball
9. After 7 minute bring the pasta to the skillet, make sure to set aside the pasta water
10. Bring the heat to medium high, you will likely need to add some more pasta water (1 or 2 ladle) to the paste, mixed well to ensure the pepper mix with the pasta and cook like this until the pasta is cooked, ensure there is still enough water
11. Once the pasta is cooked, turn of the heat
12. Add the bowl of cheese and mix carefully to ensure the cheese melt well an cream
  1. If the cheese strings, sorry, you did it wrong, likely not enough water or too much heat
13. Once the cheese is creamy, serve directly.

  

Proportions are for 1 portion, just multiply to serve more people.
