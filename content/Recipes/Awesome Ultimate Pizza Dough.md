- Flour (00) 45g 
- Water (cold) 45 g
- Yeast 0.17g


## Ingredients Main Dough (Day 2) 

- Flour (00) 425 g
- Water 285 g

- A bit of olive oil


## Ingredients Ball Up (Day 3)

## Ingredients Main Dough - Day of pizza

- Semolina flour


## Method Poolish (Day 1) 

1. In a container you can close and allowing for the poolish to rise
2. Mix water and yeast
3. Add the flour and mix to get a smooth batter, scrape the side clean with a wood spatula and cover
4. Leave to rise at room temperature for 18-24 hours.

  

Important: I skip this step and use 100g or Nan's sourdough starter for day 2


## Method  Main Dough  (Day 2) 

1. Add the water to a large bowl and stir the yeast to fully disolve
2. Add the poolish to disolve it, mix well
3. Add the salt, mix well
4. Add the flour and mix well
5. Oil your hands and the working surface (lightly) then  take the dough out and knead for 5 minutes, pull up, fold the dough under itselft. The dough will be wet but manageable
6. Once done, place in a large container, cover and place in the fridge for 12-24h.
7. The dough should 2x or 3x in size

  


## Method Ball Up (Day 3) - 

1. Oil a airtight container (lightly)
2. Oil your hands
3. Remove the dough from the container
4. Weight out into the desired size (~270g)
5. Form ball by pulling the side under the ball and tucking then on itself, make sure to pinch well and seal to avoid holes later on
6. Place the dough balls into the container, cover and place in the fridge for 1 to 4 days

  


## Method Pizza Day

1. Take the container with the balls out for at least 2 hours to ensure they get to room temperature
2. Pre-heat your oven (highest setting)
3. Dust the balls and the surface generously
4. Stretch out the dough, nice and thin, shake off the excess flour
5. Prep the pizza and bake (time depends on your oven).
