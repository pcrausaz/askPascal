### Details
**Ingredients**

- 1 Rack of Lamb
- 1 Tsp of Garlic Powder
- Salt & Pepper
- Olive Oil

**Method**

1. Pre-hreat the water bath
2. Prep the lamb, removing extra fat if needed
3. Salt and pepper both side of the rack
4. Add a Tsp of olive oil on the meaty side
5. Add the garlic powder
6. Place the rack into the a 1 gallon heat-seal bag, vacuum and seal it
  1. I find taking the loin off the rack at that stage work well.
7. Cook for 2 hours
8. Remove the meat from the water
9. Slice the meat from the bone
10. Dry out the meat
11. Place a pan on medium heat with the [Clarified Butter](Clarified Butter.md)
12.  Sear the meat on all side
13. If you have time, let the meat rest for 5 minutes under a piece of aluminum foil

Note: I sprinkled a little bit of chive to finish it.
