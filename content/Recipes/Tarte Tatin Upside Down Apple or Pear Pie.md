### Details
**Ingredients**

- 8 Apple
- 300 gr of sugar
- 50 gr of unsalted butter
- 1 Puff Pastry Dough 


**Method**

1. Pre-heat your oven to 400°F/200°C
2. Cut the dough so that it fits inside the pan
3. Cook the dough for 10 minutes, then turn over and cook for another 10 minutes, then set aside
4. Peel the apples, cut in half, remove the core, then slice 1/8 in (3 mm) of the bottom of the apple side (will use this to ensure the apple stands well
5. In a large pan, combine sugar and butter on high heat, mix while the caramel forms. When it starts to get some color, reduce the heat a bit.
  1. Tidbit: I use a pan in which I can fit some small plates that I use as weight later in the recipe.
6. Prepare a large bowl of water, you will use this to cool the caramel pan.
7. As soon as the caramel turns medium-light amber, cool the pan
8. Layout the apple sides onto the caramel, cut bottom side down, make sure to pack this well, add the cut bottom of the apple as needed. If they do not fit, set aside for later when the apple have reduced in side a bit
9. Place the plan on medium high heat, cook for 10 minutes
10. (Optional)At this point, the apples have rendered water and the caramel is very liquid. Take out a ladder of caramel and set aside
11. Cook another 10 minutes
12. Place the pre-cook dough disk on top of the apples (inside the pan)
13. Place the pan into the oven
14. Cook for 10 minutes
15. (Optional)Now paint the dough disk with the caramel set aside earlier
16. Cook for another 10 minutes
17. Take out of the oven and let cool. At this point, I set a few small plates on top of the dough disk.
18. Use a knife to separate the pie from the side, if you feel it stick and/or have trouble plating it, heat the pan a few minute, then set on a plate.

  

When using pear, I follow the same process, using about 4-5 pears, but laying the pears flat, ensuring the round side of the pear end up on top.
