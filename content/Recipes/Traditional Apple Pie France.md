### Details
**Ingredients**

- 4 Granny Smith Apples
- 1 Puff Pastry Dough Sheet
- 9 g Vanilla SugarÂ 
- 50 g of Sugar
- Little bit of unsalted butter
- Optional: a few drops of lemon juice


**Method**

1. If using frozen dough, take the dough out to thaw for about 30 minutes
2. Pre-heat the oven to 180 C / 350 F
3. Peel and core the apples
4. I use a Mandoline slicer to cut the apple cleanly but you can also do it by hand, cut the apple in segment of 3-4 mm
5. Place the cut apples in a bowl, add the lemon juice (optional, this prevents the slice to oxidize, i usually skip this step as Nan does not like it), add the vanilla sugar and 25 g of sugar, mix well
6. Butter the pie pan
7. Roll out the dough a bit, then lay it into the pan, poke it with a fork
8. Place the apple slice on the dough, start with the outer edge, all around then do another circle (or more) toward the center
9. Sprinkle the rest of the sugar on top
10. Place some tiny bits of unsalted butter on top of the apples
11. Place the pie into the oven
12. Check the pie after 35 minutes to be on the same side
13. I usually sprinkle a tad more sugar toward the end of the cooking
14. For the last few minutes, I turn the oven high broil to finish the pie
