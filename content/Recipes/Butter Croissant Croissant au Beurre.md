### Details
**Ingredients Dough**

- 500 g of All-Purpose Flour (2 cups)
- 60 g of sugar (1/3 cup)
- 10 Powdered milk (1 tbsp)
- 12 g Salt (2 tsp)
- 100 g Unsalted Butter softened (7 Tbsp)
- 25 g Fresh Yeast (1.25 cakes)
- 230 g Cold Water (a tad less of a cup)
- 250 g Unsalted Butter Chilled


**Ingredients Egg Wash**

- 1 Egg Yolk
- 1 Egg


**Method**

1. Phase 1
  1. Place flour, sugar, powered milk, 100 g softened buttered into the mixer bowl
  2. Add the yeast, crumbled
  3. Start mixing from low speed (to prevent dusting the kitchen) to medium speed, adding the cold water slowly.
  4. Keep mixing for about 6 minutes till the dough pulls away from the side and is soft, elastic and smooth.
  5. Flatten the down into a rectangle of about 25 cm
  6. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours
2. Phase 2
  1. Chill the Butter 
  2. Lightly dust the work area, get the dough out
  3. Roll the dough into a 6 mm thick rectangle, about 25 cm wide
  4. Original recipe calls for rolling the chill butter, I never succeeded in doing so....so I cut the butter in long regular slices a few mm thick
  5. Once this is done, place the butter over the bottom half of the dough rectangle, then fold the remaining part of the dough over.
  6. Rotate the dough a quarter turn so that the open side of the dough is facing you
  7. Roll the dough into another rectangle (6mm thick, 25 cm wide or so)
  8. Now fold the bottom third of the dough toward the middle, then fold down the top third over it.
  9. Now fold the entire dough in half, press it down a bit, smooth the edges.
  10. Cover it with plastic wrap and chill for an hour
3. Phase 3
  1. On a lightly floured surface, arrange the dough with an open side facing you
  2. One more time, roll the dough into a 6 mm thick rectangle, about 25 cm wide
  3. Fold the dough in 3 parts as before
  4. Cover it with plastic wrap and chill for an hour
4. Phase 4
  1. Take the dough out, arrange it on the work surface (lightly floured) with an edge facing you, this time try to make a square of 3-4 mm about 50 cm wide.
  2. Cut the dough in half
  3. Reserve one half into the fridge (drape it over the rolling pin to transfer the half you do not use to a baking sheet that you can place in the fridge).
  4. Using a pastry knife, start cutting isosceles triangle with a base of about 5cm. 
  5. Now roll each triangle into a croissant, starting from the base (duh) and place your fingers on the edges.
  6. Make sure to place the tip under the croissant
5. Phase 5 a (storage)
  1. At this point, you can freeze the croissants for later use.
  2. To do so, I place the baking sheet into the freezer, then a few hours later transfer the croissant into a bag (which I sous-vide)
6. Phase 5 b (rise & cook)
  1. As I usually do the croissant in the evening, I keep a batch in the fridge for the morning. Cover the croissant with plastic wrap while in the fridge. 2 hours before breakfast, take out the croissant, and let it rise (cover with a kitchen towel)
  2. Pre-heat the over to ~375 F (190 C)
  3. Prep your egg wash, using the yolk and the whole egg. Mix well then brush the croissants and place the croissant in the over
  4. Let it cook for about 15-25 mn depending on your oven until golden brown
  5. Take the croissant out , set on a rack and let cool.
7. Phase 5 c (rise & cook - frozen batch)
  1. As to the frozen croissant, simply take them out of the fridge on the evening.
  2. In the morning you, pre-heat the oven to 375F/190C
  3. Prep the egg wash (see above) and brush the croissants
  4. Insert the croissants in the oven for 15-25 mn depending on your oven until golden brown
  5. Take the croissant out , set on a rack and let cool.
