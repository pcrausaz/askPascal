- 1.2 Liter opf vegetable stock
- 10 cl. of white wine

**Note**: If you do not find grilled eggplant, you can simply slice up an eggplant, then grill it in a pan with a bit of olive oil.


**Method**

1. Mix the tomato paste in the vegetable stock
2. Bring the stock to a low boil
3. Boil a large pot of water, then throw in some salt and the broccoli for about 5 minutes, once cooked rinse and remove water.
4. Remove the skin and seeds from the tomatoes and cut in small cubes
5. Slice up the grilled eggplant in long slices.
6. Mince the onions
7. In a large cast iron pot, eat some olive oil and cook the onions with the rosemary for about 4 minutes, do not let them color
8. Add the rice, stir for about 3 minutes.
9. Add the white wine, let it reduce fully (evaporate)
10. Add the eggplant, the small green peas and the tomatoes
11. Add 1/3 of the stock, cover and let it cook (medium heat) until all the stock has been absorbed
12. Proceed with the remaining stock in the same manner 2 additional times (half of the remainder then the rest), always cook it covered.
13. Add a little bit of olive oil
14. Add the grated parmesan cheese (keep a tad on the side), mix with care.
15. Add the broccoli, mixing slowly just the time needed for the broccoli to heat up.
16. Taste and add salt/pepper.
17. Serve right away with a little bit of grated parmesan cheese.

**Note**: Variations: use mascarpone or gorgonzola cheese (I did not try).
