### Details
## Ingredients

- 1 pound calamari, cleaned bodies and tentacles
- Canola oil (1 liter or more)
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- salt & pepper


## Method

1. Rinse the squid, dry out water. Cut the squid bodies into rings.
2. Next we start heating our dutch oven over medium-high heat with an inch of oil. We place a candy thermometer inside the pot. We want the oil to reach 375F degrees to start frying.
3. In a large bowl we mix the flour with enough salt and pepper for it to taste seasoned. When the oil is almost to temperature, we toss about the rings and a few tentacles into the flour and stir with a fork. We lift these out and place them in a fine mesh strainer. We shake well over the flour bowl and we are ready to fry.
4. When the oil is 375 degrees, we use our chinese (spider) strainer to gently lower the squid into the oil.
5. We stir with the spider and after about 2 minutes when the squid is browned, we remove with the spider to a paper-towel lined plate.
6. We sprinkle with kosher salt and repeat with another batch of squid.
7. We eat the fried calamari as it is cooked, but we could have kept it warm in a 250F degree oven.

**Note**: what is that "we" crap?
