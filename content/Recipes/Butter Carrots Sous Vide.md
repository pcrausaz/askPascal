> My first try into Sous-Vide cooking, excellent, awesome with [Beef Tenderloin (Sous-Vide)](Beef Tenderloin Sous Vide.md) and [Butter Brussel Sprouts (Sous-Vide)](Butter Brussel Sprouts Sous Vide.md) and [Butter Carrots (Sous-Vide)](https://askpascal.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/miam/pages/430086/Butter+Carrots+Sous-Vide)

### Details
**Ingredients**

- 4-5 small carrots
- 1 Tbsp of unsalted Butter
- Salt & Pepper


**Method**

1. Peel the carrots
2. Place the carrots into the bag
3. Add the butter
4. Salt and pepper
5. Vacuum and seal the bag
6. Place into the hot bath for 45 mn
7. Place a pan to heat up with a tad of oil
8. Take out the veggies
9. Add butter to the pan and sauté the veggies for a couple of minutes

**Note**: As I have a single circulator and bath, I prep the veggies ahead of time, after they are cooked, I chill the bag into ice water then store in the fridge. When the meat is ready, I take the bag out, and immerse it 1 minute into the hot bath, then sauté the veggies
