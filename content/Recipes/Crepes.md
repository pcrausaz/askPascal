### Details
**Ingredients - Makes about 20 crêpes**

- 2 Tbsp of butter and some for the skillet
- 3 eggs 
- 1 Yolk
- 1 Vanilla bean
- 50 cl of Milk (2 cups)
- 200 g of flour (1.5 cup)
- 45 g of granulated sugar (1/4 cup)


**Method**

1. In a small cup or bowl, heat the 2 tbsp of butter in the microwave on medium to melt it
2. In a bowl, add the eggs and yolk, and whisk well, set aside
3. In a pan, add the milk
4. Split the vanilla bean, scrap the bean and place the vanilla pod and scraped bean into the milk
5. Heat the milk+vanilla up until the milk is warm, turn off the heart
6. In yet another bowl, add the flour, make a little crater into the flour, pour into the crater the egg mixture, stir together with a wooden spoon, then whisk in the warmed milk and melted butter
7. Mix well to get to a lump-less batter....if this is challenging, just strain the mixture
8. Set aside the batter to rest for at least 1 hour (I place it in the fridge, but not strictly necessary
9. When ready, take out the batter
10. In a small pan, add maybe a litter of water (1 quart) to a boil, then turn off the heat
11. Place a  saucepan (or plate) over the water
12. Now repeat
  1. Place some butter in a skillet on medium heat, Twirl the skillet to ensure there is butter all over (I use a paper towel with a piece of butter in it, then I 'paint' my skillet
  2. Pour about 1/3 ladle of batter into the skillet, tilt and twirl the skillet immediately to spread the batter
  3. Cook for about a minute
  4. Flip the crêpe with a spatula (or flip it)
  5. Cook the flip side for anther minute (it will get some brown patches but should not be burned)
  6. Stack the crêpe on the plate over the sauce pan to keep them warm (I usually place another plate on top of the crêpes to keep them warm)

  

Enjoy with granulated sugar and freshly squeeze lemon juice.

If you want to enjoy with banana and chocolate, scrape some dark chocolate, cut some banana slices, and place these over the crêpe after the first flip. Do not stack them in this case, eat right away.
