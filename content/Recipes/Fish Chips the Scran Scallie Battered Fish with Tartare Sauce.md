- 400 g of haddock or cod, skinned
- Flour for dustin
- 1 lemon quartered, to serve
- Optional: 1 gem of lettuce, halved, to serve with salt and fresh crack pepper
- Oil for frying
- Salt & Pepper


**Ingredients Tartare Sauce**

- 60 g of Gherkins (Maille Petits Cornichons are perfect)
- 30 g of capers in brine
- 1 tbsp of shallots
- 3 Tbsp of Home Mayonnaise (egg yolk, 1 tsp of mustard, mix, then emulsion with oil, dripping oil slowly while whisking energetically)
- 1-2 Tbsp of fresh parsley
- 1 half of a lemon juiced


**Ingredients Batter**

- 250 g of flour
- 125 ml of milk
- 125 ml of sparkling water
- 3 g of fresh yeast (or 1 tbsp of dry yeast)


**Method Tartare Sauce**

1. Make it 8 hours in advance, like in the morning.
2. Finely cut the gherkins
3. Rinse and chop the capers
4. Finely cut the shallots
5. Finely cur the parsley
6. Mix all with the mayo
7. Salt & pepper to taste (my add)
8. Mix well, cover and refrigerate for 8 hours


**Method Batter**

1. Warm the milk
2. Place the flour in a large bowl
3. Add the yeast
4. Mix well
5. Make a crater in the center
6. Pour slowly the warm milk into the center of the flour crater, while mixing
7. Add the sparkling water
8. Mix well, if the batter is too thick, add more sparkling water. In general, I find that I need to add 30% or 50% more water
9. Cover/film and reserve at home temperature, in a fairly warm place
10. Mix from time to time


**Method Fish**

1. Heat your oil in a large pan to 185° C
2. Pat dry the fish
3. Cut the fish to adequate sizes
4. Season the fish with salt & pepper
5. Lightly dust the fish, tapping off the excess flour
6. Give the batter a good stir
7. Dip the fish into the batter, letting the excess drip back in the bowl
8. Add the fish to the oil and fry for 4 minutes or until golden brown, gently moving the pieces apart if they touch, proceed in batches
9. Reserve the fish on paper towel

  

Season lightly with salt & pepper and serve with the tartare sauce. garnish with a lemon wedge and the half lettuce.
