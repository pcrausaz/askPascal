### Details
**Ingredients**

- 1 kg of lamb shoulder
- 4-5 chicken drumsticks (usually for the kids
- 3-4 Zuchini
- 3-4 Carrots
- 3-4 Turnips
- 1 Onion
- 250-500 gr of Garbonzo beans
- 50 gr of butter
- 500 gr (or more)Â of Couscous (semoule)
- 1 cube of veggie or chicken broth (dry cube)
- 2-3 liter of Chichen or Veggie Stock
- Tumeric
- Cumin
- Salt and pepper
- 1 stick of cinnanom
- fresh Harissa
- Olive oil


**Method**

1. Take out the butter, cut in small cube and let it get to room temperature
2. Cut the meat in chunks (1-2 inches)
3. Season the meat with cumin, tumeric, salt and pepper...be generous
4. Throw 15 gr of the butter into the pot and some olive oil
5. Saute the the meat (lamb and chicken)
6. Cover with the stock
7. Add the cube, the onion cut in 4, the cinnamon stick
8. Cover and bring to a boil
9. Reduce the heat and let it simmer 40-60 minutes
10. Check the chicken from time to time and take it out around 30 minutes, let it rest on the side (you do not want it to disintegrate into the stock)
11. Now while meat is cookin, prepare the veggies:
12. Cut the zuchinni in 3-4 cm chunks (keep the skin on, but wash them)
13. Peel and Cut the carrots in 3 or 4 cm chunks
14. Peel and Cut the turnips, cut in chunks...
15. Optional: Peel and Cut the potatoes, cut in chunks...
16. Place the couscous in a bowl and humidifie it with some of the warm/hot stock (currently cooking the meat)
17. You need to get the couscous humid...but not too much..just enough. I use a fork to keep it from aggregating I also use some kitchen cloth to wrap the garbozo beans, this will avoid later to have to go fishing for them
18. Add the veggies to the mix, along with the garbonzo beans
19. Let it cook for about 15-20 minutes.
20. Put the couscous on top of the pot (easy if you have the proper pot) and let it cook from the steam. 5-15 mn, usually I do this right after I place the veggies in the pot remember the chicken drumstick, get them back in the pot to get them warm
21. Take the couscous out, incorporate the rest of the butter
22. Now take averything out
23. Go fishing for each of the ingredients
24. Place each ingredient into a large plate(s). Couscous in the middle, meat around. beans and veggies into their own plates
25. Pour some of the liquid in a big jar
26. Serve. Usually you then mix a bit of harissa with some of the liquid then pour it on top of the couscous and the ingredients.

**Tip**: I wrap the garbonzo beans into some cheese cloth, this make it easy to retrieve. Another way to solve the problem is to take some of the liquid, then heat the beans in the liquid in a separate pan.
