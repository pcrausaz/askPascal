### Details
## Ingredients Dough

- 120 g of flour
- 3 eggs (original recipe called for 2 and that did not work for me)
- 30 g of unsalted butter (pommade)
- 8 gr of organic yeast (I used dry yeast)
- 1 pinch of salt
- 1 tsp of sugar


## Ingredients Sirup

- I had to 2x the original quantities
- 500 g of water
- 175 g of sugar
- 1 Vanilla Bean
- Discard from the rhubarb cleaning
- 1 lemon zest


## Ingredients Rhubarb Compote (paste)

- 250 g of Rhubarb
- 40 g of sugar
- 20 g of water
- 0.2 g of salt (pinch)


## Ingredients Vanilla Chantilly 

- 150 g of heavy cream
- 50 g of mascarpone
- 15 g of sugar
- 0.5 of a vanilla bean


## Ingredients Assembly 

- 10-12 Raspberries 


## Method Dough

1. Pre-heat oven at 350 F
2. Place in the mixer bowl using the 'leaf' paddle, the flour, salt and sugar
3. Break and mix the eggs in a separate bowl
4. Mix  while incorporating the eggs slowly
5. Mix for a total of 8 mn
6. Now, add the yeast and butter, again slowly, then mix for another 2 mn
7. Butter the baba mold (savarin mold) (I used two small 10 cm mold) and add the dough
8. Let it rise 45 mn
9. Place into the 350 F / 180 C oven for 15 mn
10. AFter the 15 mn, reduce the heat to 285 F/140C for another 25


## Method Sirup

1. Add the water, sugar, vanilla (scrape it and place all in the bowl), lemon zest and scraps from the Rhubarb cleaning
2. Heat the sirup to 160 F / 70 C
3. Humidify the baba on both side for about 30 mn (I bathed the baba in the sirup while basting the top, turning the cooked baba over after 15 mn)


## Method Rhubarb Compote (paste)

1. Clean the rhubarb, set aside the scraps for the sirup
2. Cut the rhubarb in fairly small pieces
3. In a pot, bring the sugar, water and salt to a boil
4. Add the cleaned rhubarb, and cook at medium setting for about 20-30 m, making sure to mix 
5. Set aside in a pipe bag and refrigerate


## Method Assembly

1. Poke holes in the cooked baba (from the top), use a pipe bag metal end (fine one)
2. Inject the rhubarb paste in the holes
3. Layer a bit of rhubarb paste on top of the baba 
4. Cover with the cream
5. Fill the raspberry with the paste and lay the raspberries on top of the baba

  

The rhubarb paste is really to die for.
