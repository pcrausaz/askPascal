### Details
**Ingredients**

- 250 ml of heavy cream
- 1/4 Pack of grated swiss cheese
- 1 Pinch of Nutmeg
- 3-4 Zucchinis (if Nan is cooking and Pascal's not home, she may keep one for the night)
- salt, olive oil, butter


**Method**

1. Butter 4 'ramequins' (little oven-proof 5-7 cm round dishes).
2. Slice the zucchinis very thin, some 3, 4 and 5 mm (I [Coco](/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=miam&title=Coco&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=430133) would say even thinner but I suck at cutting thin slices, but you really need various size to fit holes)
3. Pre-heat oven at 400 F
4. Saute (revenir) the zucchinis in a pan with enough olive oil and pour salt on them (usually takes 15 minutes, about 2 smokes but check between the cigarettes)
5. Mix the heavy cream with the swiss cheese and the nutmeg, no need for a total blend, use a fork.
6. Apply one layer of zucchinis in the ramequin, then one cuillere [spoon](/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=miam&title=spoon&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=430133) of the heavy cream mix, then one more layer of zucchini then more cream until you reach 5 mm from the top of the ramequin (if you go further, it may spill stuff over)
7. Put the 4 ramequins in the oven, let them cook for 28 minutes (one whisky and 3 or 4 smokes but check between the cigarettes), if the gratin looks black then you over cooked it, so you may need less time, I once was able to do it in 27 minutes, the top of the gratin should be a mix of yellow and brown colors
8. Remove from oven, wait 5 minutes to cool off, prepare the table, open the wine, and enjoy

et voila, so simple I(Coco)'m ashamed of myself.
