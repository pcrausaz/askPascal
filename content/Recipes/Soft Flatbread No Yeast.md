## Ingredients

- 300 g all purpose flourÂ 
  - some additional flour for dusting
- 0.5 tsp salt

## Method

1. Combine butter and milk and heat until butter is melted
2. Combine the flour, salt, butter and milk in a bowl.
3. Sprinkle flour on the work surface then knead for a couple of few minutes until it is smooth. Add extra flour if the dough is too sticky.
4. Warp the dough in plastic then rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes
5. After the resting period, cut the dough in 4 pieces, roll into balls then flatten into a ~20cm round share, about 2-3 mm thick
6. Place a cast iron skillet on high heat, wait till it is very hot
7. Add grease the pan with some olive oil and(very little)
8. Place one piece of flatbread and cook for 60-90 seconds
  1. It should puff up and get some dark brown spots
9. Once the bottom is is nicely done, flip it and cook the other side for 45-60 seconds. Again, you are looking for spots and some puffing
10. Take out and keep the cooked bread wrapped in a clean towel to keep the moisture in, which helps soften the bread.
11. Repeat with the remaining dough.
