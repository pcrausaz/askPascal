### Details
**Ingredients**

- 1 [Grade A Foie Gras](http://www.bellabellagourmet.com/foie-gras-grade-a/) Duck
- 18 g of salt
- 6 g of sugar
- 2.5 g of pepper


**Method**

1. Let the foie rest at room temperature for about 45 mn
2. Mix the spice together and pass them to the grinder to get it extremely fine
3. Now you want to have exactly 2.5% of the spice mixture, so if your foie is 700 g (1.54 lb), you will want 17.5 g of the spice mix
4. De-vein the foie, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CuuOehPBVQ) or [this shorter video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seoMhU6cDy0) shows how to do it quite well, it is in french but audio is not necessary
5. Keep track of the skin side
6. Separate the spice mix in two equal part, use the first part to sprinkle the inside (no skin), turn your foie over, and sprinkle the other side. I use a small tea strainer to do so, makes it easier to distribute nicely
7. Now take your terrine, layout the big lobe, skin down in the terrine, then add the rest, always trying to get the skin on the outside
8. Place the little weight on top (if you have one, my first try I did not have one and it was not an issue)
9. Place the terrine into a large heat-seal bag (make one if necessary) and sous-vide
10. If you have time, place the terrine for a night into the fridge
11. Get your water bath up to temperature (59 C)
12. Cook the terrine for 1 hour
13. Take the terrine out, let it cool just a tad then place into into an ice bath to get it ready for your fridge.
14. Store in the fridge for a night.  
  
  

Notes:

- On the de-veining step, make sure to get all the tiny little red spot...they do not go away after cooking. No big deal by itself but it does not look pretty. 
- On my first try, I received the foie late afternoon on 12/30 and served my first foie gras on 12/31, so the resting period were stretch to the minimum, this was not an issue. The foie gras was a success.

  



Note: This is my first, I did not have the proper terrine; the link I provided above will give you something a tad more compact.
