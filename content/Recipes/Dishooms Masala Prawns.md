> This one took me a bit by surprised, looking at the ingredient list I was not expecting that 'typical' Indian cuisine taste. These are truly excellent. Another great recipe by [Dishoom](https://www.dishoom.com/cookery-book/)....adapted of course

### Details
## Ingredients Marinade

- 20 g of cilantro/coriander, stalks and leaves
- 2-3 cloves of garlic
- 2-3 cm of ginger
- 1 or 2 Sereno pepper
- 0.25 Tsp Salt
- 1 lime juiced
- 1 Tbsp of Olive Oil
- 1 shallot
- 2-3 scallions
- 1 Tomato


## Ingredients Prawns

- 500 g of prawns or large shrimps
- 2 Tsp of chickpea flour
- 2 Tbsp of butter
- Cilantro/Coriander
- Lime wedges


## Method Marinade

1. Place all the marinade ingredient into a blender
2. Reduce everything to a paste
3. Place the paste into the cheese cloth
4. Leave it to strain for about 6-12 hours in the fridge
  1. I place the cheese cloth over a glass or coktail mixer, cover and refrigerate


## Method Prawns Marinade

1. Peel the prawns
2. Pat the prawns dry
3. Now roast the chickpeas flour (2-3 mn at medium high in a pan)
4. Place the prawns in a container
5. Add the chickpeas flour, mix well
6. Add the strained marinade (discard the water accumulated liquid)
7. Mix well
8. Cover and refrigerate for 2-3 hours


## Method Prawns

1. Prepare a few leaves & stalks of cilantro and the lime wedges
2. You can do this on the grill, I did it in a cast iron skillet
3. Place the skillet on the stove at medium high
4. Slightly oil the skillet
5. Add the prawn and let it cook, while basting the prawns with the butter
  1. the recipe recommend - when grilled - to not turn over the prawns, that did not seem right for the skillet, so I turn them over after 90 s or so and cooked them for another 90 seconds
6. Place the shrimp into a serving bowl
7. Add the cilantro and lime wedges

  

Would be great with Naan.
