### Details
## Ingredients

- 115 g of high quality dark chocolate
- 75 g of granulated sugar
- 120 ml of heavy cream
- Pinch of salt
- 28 g of unsalted butter (2 Tbsp)


## Method

1. Work when done in a pan, but I prefer to use a double boiler
2. In the pan, add the sugar, cream and salt, mix and heat up, preferably close to the boiling points
3. Add the chocolate and mix to get it to melt
4. Take out of the heat, mix in the butter
5. Ready to serve

  

The original recipe calls for adding 80 gram of light corn sirup, but I find this not necessary.
