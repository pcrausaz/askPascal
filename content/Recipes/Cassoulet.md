### Details
**Ingredients**

- 750g-1kg de Dry White Beans
- 250 gr. of bacon (slab); breast is better
- 250 gr. of pork rind (couennes)
- 2 Carots
- 4 Onions
- 2 Cloves (girofle)
- 3-4 Garlic cloves
- 1 Bouquet garni
- 500g Lamb Shoulder
- 400 gr of pork (back is just fine/echine)
- 400 gr. Ham Hock
- 1 or 2 Ham bone(s)
- 1 can of Duck Confit (usually holds 4-5 duck legs) or [homemade](Duck Confit Sous Vide.md)
- 50 gr. of Goose or Duck grease (from the can above) or worst case pork
- 3 Tomatoes
- 2-3 types of saussages (kebasha, pork etc..)


**Method**

1. Rinse the beans and set them aside in water
2. In a large pot, saute the ham bones and ham hock. Depending on what you found (i.e no bones, no ham hock) you can skip this step
3. Once saut√©, add 1 onion cut in 4, some thym, cover with cold water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for 2 hours.
4. Get the meat out, remove the bone, keep the meat and discard bones and water.
5. Place the pork rind in a cast iron pot, and let it melt (medium heat) for about 20 minutes, if you do not have the pork rind, skip this part
6. Add the beans and the bones, cover with water, add the carrots and let it simmer for 90 minutes, at mid-time (45 minutes) add salt and pepper
7. Then drain the water but MAKE SURE TO SET THE WATER ASIDE - DO NOT DISCARD THE WATER
8. Remove the bones and the onions
9. In the meantime, remove the seed and skin of the tomatoes (2 minutes in boiling water), and prepare a paste with the garlic cloves and tomatoes ... crush it all. Add tad of water if necessary
10. Pre-heat the oven at 350 F.
11. In a large pan, heat some of the duck oil, then sizzle (revenir) the pork shoulder (use some pork roast if you did not fin any) and the saussages (but in large pieces), this takes about 10 minutes
12. Add the tomatoes-garlic paste and let it cook for another 10 minutes.
13. Cut the bacon in slabs and layer it at the bottom of your cast iron pot. Keep some to cover the cassoulet (top) at the end .
14. The bottom layer will prevent the cassoulet sticking o the bottom, the top layer will provide a nice look and feel
15. Add a layer of beans on top of the bacon, about half of the beans, add salt and pepper
16. Layout part of the saussages and meat you have then the duck confit.
17. Fill the holes with beans, then layer the rest of your meat and saussages. Add salt and pepper
18. Cover now with the rest of the beans, add salt and pepper
19. Cover now with the rest of bacon
20. Add the remaining of the duck oil/grease
21. Add some of the bean water about 3-rd of the pot. Just enough...but not too much
22. Put the cast iron pot into the oven at 350 F for about an hour
23. After an hour reduce the heat to 250 and break the crust that formed on the top
24. Check the water level, you must have enough water to "wet" the beans, they must be able to suck the juices. Yummy.
25. Let it cook for about 3 hours or more
26. Take the cassoulet out and cover (I usually do this the evening before the meal)
27. Let it rest for the rest of the night
28. Now is the time to go to bed and convince your spouse of all the hardwork that was required, have fun.
29. In the morning, pre-heat the over at 350 F.
30. Place back the cassoulet an hour at 350
31. After an hour...reduce the heat to 250, break the cust, check the water level, add some bean water of necessary. If no more bean water is available, add some water
32. Check every hour, break the crust and make sure your beans are happy beans.
33. About 30 minutes before serving the meal (it is no the evening time), take the cassoulet out. Cover it and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes
34. Have a nice glass of wine
35. Break the crust one last time and bring to the table for serving.
