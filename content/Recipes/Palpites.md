### Details
## Ingredients

- 1 lb Ground Beef
- 1/2 cup Bread Crumbs
- 3-4 Cloves of Garlic
- 10-12 stem of Parsley
- Salt
- Pepper
- Vegetable Oil


## Method

1. Peel the garlic, combine with the parsley and mix it together in the mixer (or manually finely cut)
2. In a large bowl, mix the meat with the garlic and parsley, salt (1/4 tsp should be fine) and pepper; add the bread crumbs
3. Mix all the ingredients together, f you have time let that rest a few minutes in your fridge (30 minutes or so)
4. Take the preparation out, and turn it into small balls, about 1-2 cm diameter, roughly 1/2 an inch
5. Heat some oil in a non-stick pan, on medium high, then place the palpites in there, then turn the heat to medium. Cook for about 20 mn, turning the palpites over a few times. Do not hesitate to turn your heat back up if you see the meat render too much water.

Excellent with a yogurt cilantro/chive dip.
