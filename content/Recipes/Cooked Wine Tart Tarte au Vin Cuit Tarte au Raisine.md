### Details
**Ingredients**

- 250 g of [Sugar Dough / Pâte Sucrée](Sugar Dough Pate Sucree.md)
- Flan/Custard
  - 3 eggs
  - 1 yolk
  - 1.5 dl of heavy cream
  - 1 dl of Vin Cuit


**Method**

1. Pre-heat over at 250℃ /480℉ Prepare your dough, ideally a disk of 3-4 mm thick. Dust lightly.
2. Lay the dough (fonce) in the pie plate, and cover the center with a aluminium disk, 10 mn into the cooking remove the disk
3. Cook the pie crust for about 20 mn (depends on your oven)
4. Take the pie crust out and let it cool
5. Pre-heat oven at 180℃ /350℉
6. In a bow mix the ingredients for the flan/custard: eggs, cream and Vin Cuit
7. Out most of it into the pie but not so much that you can not move the pie. Place the pie into the oven, top it with the remaining part of the custard.
8. Keep the oven door open and cook for about 25 mn or until the custard is set

Note: for a small pie, I cut the proportions in half.
