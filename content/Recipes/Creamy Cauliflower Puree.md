> Original Recipe at [https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/creamy-cauliflower-puree](https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/creamy-cauliflower-puree) . My version is pretty close but does not contain lemon juice and adds pepper

### Details
**Ingredients**

- 500 gr of Cauliflower (1 medium head)
- 150 gr of water (I up the water from the original recipe)
- 85 gr of butter
- 3 gr of Salt
- Black Pepper to taste

*Note:* Delicious results with 50% cauliflower and 50% Brussel sprouts. The base recipe also works with carrots, and anything you fancy.


**Method**

1. Chop the cauliflower in small pieces
2. Place in a pan
3. Add the water and the butter
4. Cover and heat on high for a few minutes
5. Once it starts steaming, reduce the power to medium
6. Keep an eye on it so that it does not scorche, add water if necessary
7. Cook until tender, about 30 mn total time
8. Place in a blender, blend until creamy
9. Add black pepper to taste

*Note:*

- I keep the cooked cauliflower in the pan until the last minute. I skip the lemon from the original recipe as Nan is not a big fan of lemon in cooked dishes.
- To serve the puree as decoration, half the quantities
