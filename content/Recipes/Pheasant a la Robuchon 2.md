### Details
## Ingredients

- [Clarified Butter](Clarified Butter.md)
- [Braised Endives](Braised Endives.md)
- 1 Pheasant (I actually prefer it with duck)
- 3oz of Foie Gras
- 1 Carrot
- 1 Large Onion
- 3 Garlic Cloves

### Ingredients Sealing Dough

- 1 cup of all-purpose flour
- 3-4 egg white (keep the yolk for the egg wash)

**Note**: Usually I make 2 servings of dough since I use 2 birds. The left-over yolk are perfect for a [Lemon Pie](Lemon Pie.md)  
**Warning**: imho it needs another side, like [Roasted Potatoes](/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=miam&title=Roasted%20Potatoes&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=430172) or [Braised Green Beans](/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=miam&title=Braised%20Green%20Beans&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=430172)


## Method

### Method Dough

1. Separate the yolk and white of 3 eggs. Set both yolk and withe aside
2. Mix 1 coup of flour with 3 egg white until the dough is soft and pliable (add a 4th egg white if not soft enough)
3. Wrap the dough is a plastic sheet and store at room temperature

### Method Bird

1. Chill the casserole lid for at least 20 min
2. Pre-heat oven 475F
3. Set the bird gibblets aside
4. Season the bird inside with salt and pepper, then add the foie gras inside the cavity
5. Season the outside of the bird
6. In an oven proof skillet, melt [Clarified Butter](Clarified Butter.md) over medium-high heat
7. Brown bird on each side for about 3 min per side then brown back of bird for about 4 min. (Tot 10 min)
8. Slice coarsly the onion and the carrot add to the skillet
9. Add the un-peeled garlic cloves to the skillet
10. Add the gibblets
11. Place bird on the side, then roast 3 minutes in the oven, with the thicker part of the bird toward the back of the back of the oven
12. Turn over on the other side, roast for another 3 minutes
13. Place bird on back and roast another 4 minutes
14. Remove skillet from the oven and place bird on a plate
15. Season again the bird some more with salt and pepper
16. Now return the skillet to the stove - high heat - along with the juice, veggies and gibblets for about 3 minutes
17. Spoon off the fat (may not have much to spoon off), then add a cup and half (1.5) of water to deglaze
18. Reduce for about 5 minutes
19. Strain and set the liquid aside, you should have about 1 cup. Make sure to press the gibblet to extract the juices.
20. Reduce oven to 425F
21. Place the [Braised Endives](Braised Endives.md) at the bottom of the oven proof casserole, try to extrac some of the water from the endives
22. Add the bird on top of the endives
23. Pour the juices over the bird
24. Prepare a glaze with one egg yolk and a teaspoon of water
25. Cut the pastry dough in 4, then roll each quarter in a 4in. strip (you will use the strip to seal the lid)
26. Place the lid on the casserole and wrap pastry strip around the lid to seal. Press to make a tight lid
27. Brush the dough with the egg wash
28. Place the casserole in the oven for about 15 minutes per pound
29. Remove the casserole from the oven....do not open...let rest 10 minute (no more than 30)
30. After 10 minutes, open, then dress the bird and serve the endives as a side

**Notes**: 1 Pheasant will serve 2 large or 4 smalls. You can also switch the pheasant for a duck.
