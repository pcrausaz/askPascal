### Details
**Ingredients**

- 1 Duck
- 1 kg of potatoes (fingerlings are great for this)
- 4-5 Cloves of garlic (unpeeled)
- 2 shallots
- 1.5 Cup of white wine (I used a nice sauvignon)
- 1 cup of mushrooms (any kind)
- 2-3 Laurel leaves
- 2-3 twigs of Thyme
- Salt & Pepper
- Duck Fat (if you have any, otherwise render some from the duck)


**Method**

1. Pre-heat oven to 350F
2. Prepare the duck, take the neck, cut in 2 or 3 parts and set aside
3. Set aside the liver, heart and other giblets and set aside
4. Cut out the two magrets (breasts) and set aside
5. Cut out the legs and set aside
6. Salt and pepper on the duck parts
7. In a saute pan, render some duck fat on medium high heat (if you do not have duck fat, keep some aside for later)
8. Add the legs and magrets to get some color on each side, about 4-5 minutes on each side
9. Add the shallots sliced, cook a few minutes
10. Add the cloves of garlic, with the skin, lightly crushed
11. Add the thyme, laurel and the white wine
12. Bring to a boil
13. Cover and insert into the oven for 40 minutes, at that point it will be time to prep the potatoes
14. Clean the potatoes (I keep the skin on) and cut into 2 cm pieces
15. Heat some duck fat into a pan
16. Add the potatoes and cook on medium high heat for about 5-8 minutes
17. Salt and pepper on the potatoes
18. Take the cocotte out of the oven, turn over the duck pieces
19. Add the potatoes to the cocotte, check the liquid, add more if necessary
20. Cover and cook in the oven for another 25-30 ns
21. At this point, you can either serve either take the potatoes and duck out and broil for a few minutes, then serve
22. Check also the consistency of your liquid, if too necessary reduce a bit while you broil the elements.
23. Check salt and pepper for taste and serve
