## Method

### Method for Marinade

1. Mix the marinade together, chopped the garlic garlic and add all the ingredients: white vinegar, soy sauce, lime juice, olive oil, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, dried oregano, ground cumin.
2. Pour the marinade in a ziplock bag and add the flank steak (whole). Mix well, let rest for an hour or more (up to 8).

### Method for Tacos

1. Chop the onions, the jalapenos and the cilantro, add the juice of 1 lime; mix well.
2. Take the meat out of the bag, then slice is small strips (about 1cm by 1/2 cm)
3. Place a pan over low heat, and heat up the tortillas; you can also do this in the microwave (1 mn or so)
4. Place a skillet over medium-high heat, then add the pieces of meat (do not pour the liquid in). Cook, always stirring until the meat is cooks to your taste (about 10 mn); until all the liquid evaporates.
5. Now build your tacos, on each plate (this will make about 12 tortillas), lay a couple of tortillas, add some meat, then add the mixture of onions, jalapenos and lime.

**Note**:Some add salsa on top of it, but I do not find it necessary.
