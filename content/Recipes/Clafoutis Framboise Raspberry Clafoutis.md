### Details
## Ingredients

- 400-500 g of Raspberry (or Cherries)
- 20 cl of heavy cream
- 25 cl of whole milk
- 125 g of sugar
- 2 pack of vanilla sugar
- 2 whole eggs
- 2 yolks
- 60 g of Maizena (cornstarch)
- Pinch of salt
- Butter for the plates


## Method

1. Pre-heat oven at 350 **°**F / 180 **°**C
2. Butter your plates
3. Clean and dry the raspberries
4. In a bowl, add the Maizena, sugar, salt and vanilla sugar and mix well
5. Add the whole eggs and egg yolks, mix well
6. Add the cream and milk, mix well
7. In the buttered plate, layout out the berries
8. Just cover the berries with the mixture
9. Place into the over for about 30 minutes

You can eat these warm or cold. Both are great.

Note the cooking time is short because I just cover the berries over a single layer of berries, if you were to have a larger amount of mixture over the berries, you could extend the cooking time by about 10 more minutes.

  

I was able to do 1 large dish and 4 ramequins with the proportions above.
