### Details
## Ingredients - dough

- 1 Cup flour
- 1/4 Tsp Salt
- 1/3 Cup of water (cold) - Likely need to adjust
- 115 g of unsalted butter


## Ingredients - Syrup

- 3/4 Cup of sugar
- 1/4 Cup of water
- Lemon Zest


## Ingredients - Cream

- 1/3 Cup Flour
- 1/4 Tsp Salt
- 1.5 Cup of Milk
- 6 Yolk
- 1 Vanilla bean


## Method - Dough

1. The day before, prepare the butter pastry dough.
2. Take the butter out, cut in small piece
3. In a bowl, combine flour, salt and cold water, mix until it comes together. It will be a sticky dough. Adjust the water level so that the dough is soft and sticky, lately, I had to almost double the amount of water.
4. On a well floured surface, roll the dough to 3mm thick in a square share - about 40cm x 40 cm
5. I usually cream the butter using a whip or a mixer, makes it easier to apply.
6. Apply the butter to 2/3 of the rectangle
7. Using 1/3 of your butter: fold the 1/3 without butter over the 1/3 next to it, then fold the last buttered 1/3 on top of it. Ensure you have a nice rectangle. For all this operation, you may need to use a dough scraper as the dough is sticky
8. Now turn the dough 90° and repeat the process above (shapre in rectangle, butter, fold)
9. Place the dough in the fridge for 10 mn
10. Take the dough out, roll it to a quare again
11. Now with the remaining 1/3 of butter, paint your dough all the way but for the last couple of cm at the top of the rectangle
12. Now, roll the dough, starting at the side with the butter, toward the side without butter, stop a few cm before you get to the non-butter side
13. Wet your fingers to humidify the part of the dough without butter and finish rolling
14. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap, place in the fridge at least a couple of hours or - better - overnight. You can also freeze the dough if you want at this point.


## Method - Syrup

1. Place the water, sugar and zest into a pan over medium heat and boil.
2. No need to really steer but you can, wait till the sugar has dissolve completely


## Method - Cream

1. Whisk flour, salt, scrapped vanilla bean and milk together into a pan
2. Place the pan over medium heat, always stirring, for about 5 minutes until it thicken
3. Remove from heat and let it cool a bit
4. In a separate bowl, whisk the yolks together
5. Temper the yolks (a little bit of lukewarm milk/flour mixture), mix well
6. Mix well with the remaining milk/flour mixture, add the syrup, mix well again
7. Ensure the vanilla bean is out
8. Mix well, strain and place in a large glass measuring cup (easier to pour later on).


## Method - Assembly

1. Pre-heat oven at 500F (original recipe called for the max temperature - mine is 550 F - this was a tad too high).
2. Unwrap the dough, cut the dough side if needed to trim it properly
3. Cut in 3mc piece
4. Place each dough piece into a muffin pan hole
5. Using your thumb (you can wet your thumb to make it easier), press down the dough against the bottom and up the side, streching the dough to make it wrap inside the muffin hole, basically creating a dough cup. Repeat for all the dough pieces. Trim as needed.
6. Pour the cream up to about 3/4 of the dough cup
7. Bake in the pre-heat oven until well browned and bubbly. Here is how I made the second batch: 7 mn at 500 F, then up to 550 F for another 2 mn.

Traditionally served warm, but also great cold.


First Batch at 550 F:




Second Batch at 500F:




...and yes, I need a new muffin pan.
