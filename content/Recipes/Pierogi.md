### Details
**Ingredients Filling**

- 1 kg pork belly or pork butt
- 1 kg of Sauerkraut
- 60 g of dry porcini mushroomsÂ 


**Ingredients Dough**

- 1 kg of flour (50% T45 and 50% T55....or just 100% plain flour)
- 2 or 3 cups of milk
- 17 g of salt


**Method Filling**

1. Place the dry mushrooms into water to get them soft
2. Boil pork till tender
3. Boil sauerkraut for 15-20 mn
4. Boil mushrooms till cooked, also about 15-20 mn
5. Grind everything
6. Add salt and pepper to taste, mix well
7. Oil for the last frying step

  


**Method Dough**

1. Mix flour, salt then add milk
2. Try not to knead too much or it becomes elastic and you want to avoid this
3. No need to rest the dough

  


**Method Assembly**

1. Spread the dough, fairly thin (1 or 2 mm), then using the cookie cutter get the circle out
  1. It is easier if you cut piece of dough you spread (like a 1/4 or a 1/3)
  2. You can re-use the scrap dough, and repeat the process
2. Take a circle, add about 1-2 tsp of filling, very lightly wet the side, then close the dumpling using a fork on the sides coming together.
3. Go through the dough and build all the dumplings, laying them out on a clean kitchen towel until you are ready to cook. It is best if you do not wait too long so that the dumplings do not dry out

  


**Method Cooking**

1. Boil a large pot of water
2. Drop a few dumplings into the boiling water
3. When the dumplings rise, take them out and lay to dry on some tray (or paper towel)
  1. Go through all the dumplings before going to the next step
4. In a pan, heat some oil (medium heat), about 1 cm, when the oil is hot, place the dumplings into the pan, a few minutes on each side, then set aside and finish frying all the dumplings.

  

If you are not going to eat all the dumplings, you can freeze them after boiling but before frying.
