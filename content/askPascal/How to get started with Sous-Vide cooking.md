#### Where do I find information on Sous-Vide cooking?

To get started with Sous-Vide cooking, you have many resources out there. First and foremost….if not completely out of reach (and way too expensive) is the amazing book

 [http://www.amazon.com/Modernist-Cuisine-Art-Science-Cooking/dp/0982761007/ref=sr\_1\_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1387518546&sr=1-2&keywords=modernist+cuisine](http://www.amazon.com/Modernist-Cuisine-Art-Science-Cooking/dp/0982761007/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1387518546&sr=1-2&keywords=modernist+cuisine)

A smaller, more affordable version of the book  is [http://modernistcuisine.com/books/modernist-cuisine-at-home/](http://modernistcuisine.com/books/modernist-cuisine-at-home/). You can also fallback on the iPad/iPhone app which is even more affordable: [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/modernist-cuisine-at-home/id731685730?ls=1&mt=8](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/modernist-cuisine-at-home/id731685730?ls=1&mt=8). I suspect the app has a tad less information than the book but I did not verify this to be true, a cursory inspection of the book/app did not reveal significant differences.

On the web, check the Modernist recipe section (free) at  [http://modernistcuisine.com/recipes/](http://modernistcuisine.com/recipes/) 

Tons of good free references - for free - as well on the web:

And of course my own recipe site at: [http://askpascal.com](http://askpascal.com) [http://askpascal.com/wiki/index.php/Category:Recipe:Meal-SousVide](http://askpascal.com/wiki/index.php/Category:Recipe:Meal-SousVide). Not much there sous-vide-wise as I am just starting on sous-vide.

#### What gear do I need?

Now for the gear, at minimum, you need a stove that can keep the proper temperature, but I recommend that at minimum - for better results - you go with a Sous-vide supreme:

Personally, I favor a circulator, a tad more geeky, but better control imho on the temperature, I like (and own) a Polyscience Circulator

\[Update\] Many new devices are available since I wrote this, check [Joule](https://www.chefsteps.com/joule), [Sansaire](https://sansaire.com), etc...

Both sites also offer the basic sous-vide recipes.

You need something to get the food sous-vide (under vacuum), the simpler no-gear method is to use the water displacement method and some ziplock bags: here is a video that shows how to prep Salmon using that method: [http://www.chefsteps.com/activities/simple-sous-vide-packaging](http://www.chefsteps.com/activities/simple-sous-vide-packaging)

You can also use a very affordable, vacuum sealer such as: [http://www.foodsaver.com/vacuum-sealers/FSFSSL2244-P00.html](http://www.foodsaver.com/vacuum-sealers/FSFSSL2244-P00.html)

Both work well, a buddy of mine (yes, Art this is you) is trying to convince me to get a 'true' vacuum chamber~, but I am resisting~.

It has the advantage of dealing way better with liquids and give you more control on the ‘strength' of the vacuum, which for food like fish matter a bit: [http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YE8FG0/ref=wl\_it\_dp\_o\_pC\_nS\_ttl?\_encoding=UTF8&colid=3FHCNOI768POD&coliid=IQYK8RIORW2CA](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YE8FG0/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=3FHCNOI768POD&coliid=IQYK8RIORW2CA)

Have fun!
