Make sure the nuts are flat and not bunch together\n\n\nOptional: set aside 30 g for the final decoration\n\n\nOnce it is cool, add to the food processor and grind to a paste\n\n\nStore, air tight and at room temperature\n\n\nMethod Sirup\n\nDo this while the dough is baking\nAdd sugar and water to a pan\nBring to a boil until the sugar is well melted\nSet aside\n\nMethod Assembly\n\n\nTake the dough out\n\n\nLightly flour your work surface\n\n\nRoll he dough to a large rectangle, dough should be about 3-4 mm, and the rentable something like 50 cm over 25…size is not that critical\n\n\nOnce your dough rectangle is ready, spread the Praline over the surface of the rectangle\n\n\nOptional: You can sprinkle some crushed roasted nuts (50g or so)\n\n\nNow, roll the dough into a cylinder\n\n\nThen cut the cylinder in 4-5 cm pieces (2 in)\n\n\nOn a sheet pan, cover with a silk pat or parchment paper\n\n\nPlace your high wall circles and place a few dough cylinder in each\n\n\nLet this proof for an hour\n\n\nPre-heat your oven at 180C/350F\n\n\nOnce the dough has proofed, place in the oven for 15-20 mn\n\n\nTake out, let it cool for 5-10 minutes\n\n\nPrepare your sirup\n\n\nUn-mold the babka\n\n\nBrush the babka with the sirup\n\n\nAdd some very roughly rcushed praline  on top (the 30 g you had set aside, if you forgot, just make some more 30g should be plenty.\n\n\nContinici add some salted caramel, likely a good thing to do…maybe next time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummaryServe6-8Preparation Time60 mn + rest timeCooking Time20 mn + 20 mnAuthorsPascal Crausaz / Inspiration Philippe Conticini &amp; Jeffrey CagnesSpecial HardwareParchment PaperHigh wall circle (like the circle of a spring baking mold)\n\n\n"},"Recipes/baby-back-ribs":{"slug":"Recipes/baby-back-ribs","filePath":"Recipes/baby-back-ribs.md","title":"baby-back-ribs","links":["mailto:pascal@askpascal.com"],"tags":[],"content":"Baby Back Ribs\n\n\n                  \n                  INFO\n                  \n                \n\nMoist and tender to perfection\n\n\nIngredients\n\n1 Rack of Baby back ribs\n1 Tbsp of cracked Pepperr\n1 Tbsp of kosher salt\n1/2 Tbsp of Paprika\n1/2 Tbsp of Ground Mustard Seeds\n1/4 Tsp of Cayenne Pepper\nOptional: your favorite bbq sauce (personally I skip this)\nAluminium foil\n\nMethod\n\nMake sure to remove the inner skin of your ribs if your butcher has not done it yet as it makes for chewing bits if you do not\nCut the Rack in two\nMix all the spices\nRub the ribs with the spices\nWrap each half rib rack in two layers of aluminum foil\nPlace the rack into a 350 F oven for about two hours (90 mms works was well if you are in a hurry)\nWhen the ribs are about ready, pre-heat your BQQ on medium-high\nWhen the ribs are done, un-wrap while carefully recover the juices - Optional: if you are going to use BBQ sauce, mix the juices with theBBQ sauce, and rub the ribs\nPlace the rib on the BBQ town down for 4 minutes\nTurn the ribs and cook for another 4 minutes\nTurn one last time for 4 more minutes (Total on the bbq is about 10-12 minutes)\nRemove the ribs from the BBQ\nCut the ribs and serve, add more BBQ sauce if this is your thing\n\nYou may need to cook a tad more on the BBQ if you use sauce.\nsee also: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork_ribs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummaryTraditionalServe2Preparation Time5 mnCooking Time2 h + 10-15 mnAuthorsPascal Crausaz"},"Recipes/baked-beans":{"slug":"Recipes/baked-beans","filePath":"Recipes/baked-beans.md","title":"baked-beans","links":["Recipes/braised-lamb-shanks","mailto:pascal@askpascal.com"],"tags":[],"content":"Baked Beans\n\n\n                  \n                  INFO\n                  \n                \n\nPerfect with the Braised Lamb Shanks\n\n\nIngredients\n\n3 small cans of White Beans\n3-4 slice of extra thick bacon\n1-2 cup of water\n1 Onion chop\n2-3 garlic cloves, chopped\n1 Tsp of sugar\n1 Tsp of ground mustard seed\nSalt &amp; pepper\n\nMethod\n\nPre-heat oven @ 325 F\nDrain the beans\nIn a cast iron pot, render the bacon, add the onion, the garlic, mustard seed, sugar, salt and pepper.

Take the meat out, mix in the flour with the meat. Put the bacon into the pot, then throw in the bacon cut in pieces (small), let the bacon sweat a bit. Put the butter into the pot, add in the carrots and the onions sliced (both).\nAdd back the meat, mixed on high heat, let the flour color a bit.\nAdd the red wine, salt, pepper, tomato paste, bouquet garni, garlic and broth or water, bring to a boil then reduce heat and cook 2 hours or so.\n30 minutes before the end cook the potatoes (if possible above the meat).\nServe directly in the pot. I find it best with boiled potatoes that I simply roughly crush in the plate, then I lay out the stew on top\n\nNote marinate the meat a night before with red wine and some aromats (bouquet garnit, ail, oigon + olive oil etc…). Dry the meat before use, and replace some of the wine by the marinade when cooking.\nMargo’s note: If you want to try an untraditional venison, this recipe also works wonderfully with version in place of beef.

If you have doubts or do not know if your Kirsch is flavored, use cognac.\n\n2 TSP of cornstarch\n4-5 cloves of garlic\nFreshly crushed black pepper\n\nMethod\n\nCut all the cheese in small strip or better grate/shred it\nMix the cornstarch and the cognac, set aside.\nPeel the garlic cloves and rub the inside of the pot with it\nAdd the wine in the pot.\nHeat the mix at medium heat\nWhen the wine is hot, add the cheese, stir (from now on, you always stir, never leave the pot un-attended\nStirring is a serious matter \n tradition says you need to stil in a 8 shape using a wood spoon..preferably a slotted spoon.\nIf you have a lot of people, hence a lot of cheese, you may want to add the cheese bit by bit to make it easier.\nStir, Stir and stir…until all is melted.\nOnce all the cheese is melted, get someone to light the burner on the table.\nThrow in the mix of cognac and cornstarch, continue to stir for about 1 minute.It should foam a bit.\nFresh black pepper and dinner is ready!\n\nBring the pot at the table, keep the heat on medium or so (light boil), you will see the cheese tends to firm up if it gets too cold (btw, until someone throw a fork with bread into the pot, you are still stirring the fondue ). \nYou will notice, there is no salt, usually the cheese has plenty of&lt; salt. I never had to add salt. \nInstruct the people around the table to not-scratch the bottom of the pot. You want this intact until the end. \nOnce the cheese is all gone (watch the burner when the cheese get low, you do not want the cheese at the bottom to burn black), you should have a crusty layer of cheese, you can scratch these and eat it.

egg yolks, whole egg, sugar, butter, and buttermilk.\nAdd approximately 2 cups of the flour along with the yeast and salt; whisk until moistened and combined.\nRemove the whisk attachment and replace with a dough hook.\nAdd all but 3/4 cup of the remaining flour and knead on low speed for 5 minutes.\nCheck the consistency of the dough, add more flour if necessary; the dough should feel soft and moist but not sticky. Knead on low speed 5 minutes more or until the dough clears the sides of the bowl.\nTurn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface; knead by hand about 30 seconds.\nLightly oil a large bowl.\nTransfer the dough to the bowl, lightly oil the top of the dough\ncover and let double in volume, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.\n\nMethod Filling\n\nCombine the brown sugar, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl.\nMix until well incorporated.\nSet aside until ready to use.\n\nMethod Dough (End Assembly)\n\nButter a 9 by 13-inch glass baking dish.\nTurn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface.\nGently shape the dough into a rectangle with the long side nearest you.\nRoll into an 18 by 12-inch rectangle.\nBrush the dough with the 3/4-ounce of melted butter, leaving 1/2-inch border along the top edge.\nSprinkle the filling mixture over the dough, leaving a 3/4-inch border along the top edge;\ngently press the filling into the dough.\nBeginning with the long edge nearest you, roll the dough into a tight cylinder. Firmly pinch the seam to seal and roll the cylinder seam side down.\nVery gently squeeze the cylinder to create even thickness. Using a serrated knife, slice the cylinder into 1 1/2-inch rolls; yielding 12 rolls.\nArrange rolls cut side down in the baking dish; cover tightly with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator overnight or up to 16 hours.\n\nMethod Cooking The Next Day\n\nRemove the rolls from the refrigerator and place in an oven that is turned off.\nFill a shallow pan 2/3-full of boiling water and set on the rack below the rolls.\nClose the oven door and let the rolls rise until they look slightly puffy; approximately 30 minutes.\nRemove the rolls and the shallow pan of water from the oven.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\nWhen the oven is ready, place the rolls on the middle rack and bake until golden brown, or until the internal temperature reaches 190 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, approximately 30 minutes.\n\nMethod Icing on the roll\n\nWhile the rolls are cooling slightly, make the icing by whisking the cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer until creamy. Add the milk and whisk until combined. Sift in the powdered sugar, and whisk until smooth.

Séparer les têtes et les pinces du corps. Décortiquer les pinces et les queues. Couper les queues en deux sur la longueur, enlever le boyau et récupérer un maximum de corail. Réserver.\nRéaliser la base pour la sauce : ouvrir les têtes en deux en pensant à éliminer la poche de sable. Les concasser avec un marteau. Dans les 75 grammes de beurre salé, faire revenir les carapaces, ajouter le vin de Xérès et donner un gros bouillon. Ajouter la vanille émincée, les graines de rocou, les graines de coriandre, le cacao amer, les branches de cerfeuil et mouiller avec le bouillon de volaille, le fumet d’étrille et l’eau. Cuire doucement 3/ 4 d’heure, afin d’obtenir une réduction de 1/ 3 du volume de départ. Filtrer à la passoire fine en pressant fortement.\nRéaliser la garniture : râper (trous moyens) complètement la mangue verte pelée et réserver.\nDestination\n5 à 10 minutes avant de servir, saisir avec les 25 grammes de beurre salé les 1/ 2 queues et les pinces. Réserver dans un plat et couvrir avec un linge humide pour éviter le dessèchement. Garder au chaud dans le four à 100°C. Déglacer le récipient de cuisson avec le vinaigre de Xérès, donner un bouillon, ajouter la base et faire réduire d’un bon 1/3. Ajouter les 35 grammes de beurre restant et le corail récupéré . Lorsque le beurre et le corail sont incorporés, la sauce ainsi obtenue doit être d’une consistance légèrement sirupeuse.

The whole process should take you about 20 minutes\nCover the dough with a cloth and keep at room temperature. Let the dough rest for about 1 hour.\nAfter an hour the dough should have more or less double its size.\none option is to make the portion before the dough rise and let the portion rise. Lately this is what I have been doing.\nTake about 70 gr of dough, then roll it into a 25cmx10cm rectangle. Repeat the operation until you have no more dough\nSlice the tomatoes into very thin slices, the thiner the better\nSeason the tomatoes with salt and pepper\nSlice the cheese into very thin slices\nOpen the anchovies can, remove all liquid\nStuff each rectangle of dough with a couple of slices of tomatoes and a couple of slices of cheese. Add one anchovie. Place the ingredients on one side about 2 cm from the edge, then fold the other side on top and seal the dough by pitching the dough between 2 fingers. It helps to wipe the edge of the dough with a little bit of the tomatoes juices before folding the side. Once close, you have your panzerote\nSet the panzerote aside, place it on a cloth so as it does not stick on the counter or table surface\nPour the oil into a frying pan\nHeat the oil at medium-high heat\nInsert a 2-3 panzerote into the hot oil, watch out for oil burns here, be very careful\nAfter 1 or 2 minutes turn the panzerote over and fry another minute or so. Nothing should spill out of the pocket, if it does check the seal and press the dough again if needed.\nTake the panzerotes out of the oil (keep them a few second on top of the pan to let the oil drip), and place into a bowl lined with a couple of paper towel sheets.\nRepeat the operation with the remaining panzerotes, inserting paper towel sheets between each new layer of panzerote.\nServe as soon as the complete batch is done\n\nNote: Mic suggest subtituing a little bit of milk as per Nine’s latest adaptation to get a more crispy dough. You can also add a tablespoon of white vinegar which is supposed to make it less oily.\nWarning: The hot tomato juice inside the panzerote is a killer, so watch out, it is very very hot inside.

Not sure how they compare to the original, never had one before.\n\n\nIngredients - dough\n\n1 Cup flour\n1/4 Tsp Salt\n1/3 Cup of water (cold) - Likely need to adjust\n115 g of unsalted butter\n\nIngredients - Syrup\n\n3/4 Cup of sugar\n1/4 Cup of water\nLemon Zest\n\nIngredients - Cream\n\n1/3 Cup Flour\n1/4 Tsp Salt\n1.5 Cup of Milk\n6 Yolk\n1 Vanilla bean\n\nMethod - Dough\n\nThe day before, prepare the butter pastry dough.\nTake the butter out, cut in small piece\nIn a bowl, combine flour, salt and cold water, mix until it comes together. It will be a sticky dough. Adjust the water level so that the dough is soft and sticky, lately, I had to almost double the amount of water.\nOn a well floured surface, roll the dough to 3mm thick in a square share - about 40cm x 40 cm\nI usually cream the butter using a whip or a mixer, makes it easier to apply.\nApply the butter to 2/3 of the rectangle\nUsing 1/3 of your butter: fold the 1/3 without butter over the 1/3 next to it, then fold the last buttered 1/3 on top of it. Ensure you have a nice rectangle. For all this operation, you may need to use a dough scraper as the dough is sticky\nNow turn the dough 90° and repeat the process above (shapre in rectangle, butter, fold)\nPlace the dough in the fridge for 10 mn\nTake the dough out, roll it to a quare again\nNow with the remaining 1/3 of butter, paint your dough all the way but for the last couple of cm at the top of the rectangle\nNow, roll the dough, starting at the side with the butter, toward the side without butter, stop a few cm before you get to the non-butter side\nWet your fingers to humidify the part of the dough without butter and finish rolling\nWrap the dough in plastic wrap, place in the fridge at least a couple of hours or - better - overnight. You can also freeze the dough if you want at this point.\n\nMethod - Syrup\n\nPlace the water, sugar and zest into a pan over medium heat and boil.\nNo need to really steer but you can, wait till the sugar has dissolve completely\n\nMethod - Cream\n\nWhisk flour, salt, scrapped vanilla bean and milk together into a pan\nPlace the pan over medium heat, always stirring, for about 5 minutes until it thicken\nRemove from heat and let it cool a bit\nIn a separate bowl, whisk the yolks together\nTemper the yolks (a little bit of lukewarm milk/flour mixture), mix well\nMix well with the remaining milk/flour mixture, add the syrup, mix well again\nEnsure the vanilla bean is out\nMix well, strain and place in a large glass measuring cup (easier to pour later on).\n\nMethod - Assembly\n\nPre-heat oven at 500F (original recipe called for the max temperature - mine is 550 F - this was a tad too high).\nUnwrap the dough, cut the dough side if needed to trim it properly\nCut in 3mc piece\nPlace each dough piece into a muffin pan hole\nUsing your thumb (you can wet your thumb to make it easier), press down the dough against the bottom and up the side, streching the dough to make it wrap inside the muffin hole, basically creating a dough cup. Repeat for all the dough pieces. Trim as needed.\nPour the cream up to about 3/4 of the dough cup\nBake in the pre-heat oven until well browned and bubbly. Here is how I made the second batch: 7 mn at 500 F, then up to 550 F for another 2 mn.\n\nTraditionally served warm, but also great cold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummaryServe8-10 piecesPreparation Time20 mn + 1 dayCooking Time8-10 mnAuthorsPascal Crausaz / Various web recipesHardwareMuffin panPlastic wrapDough scrapper\nFirst Batch at 550 F:\n\n\n\nSecond Batch at 500F:\n\n\n\n…and yes, I need a new muffin pan.\n"},"Recipes/perfect-yolk":{"slug":"Recipes/perfect-yolk","filePath":"Recipes/perfect-yolk.md","title":"perfect-yolk","links":["mailto:pascal@askpascal.com"],"tags":[],"content":"Perfect Yolk\n\n\n                  \n                  NOTE\n                  \n                \n\nInteresting way with delicious results.\n\n\nIngredients\n\n1 Yolk\n250 ml of vegetable oil\n\nMethod\n\nIt is easier to do in a small metal container that you will place into your water bath.\nAdd some neutral oil into the metal container, pre-heat into your sous-vide bath\nCarefully separate the yolk from the white and place the yolk into the oil bath.

But if you’ve got a free Gmail account (get one here) you can use Google’s SMTP server to send mail through Thunderbird from you@example.com Update: Google rewrites the from address to your Gmail address..\nHow to set it up\nIn your email client software, under Outgoing mail, set the SMTP server to smtp.google.com. Set the your username is yourgooglemailname@gmail.com and make sure “Use username and password” is checked. Also check off “TLS” under “Use secure connection.” And voila! You can send mail for any email address from any network (that lets you connect to an outside SMTP server) using your Gmail account - be sure to enter your Gmail password when prompted.\nCheck out Gmail’s help section on POP access for Gmail for specific instructions for setting this up with your email program. If you only want to use the SMTP server, skip the POP bits and only set up SMTP to work with your existing email account.\nUpdate 1\nI was remiss not to point out that Gmail will set the from address for messages sent through smtp.google.com to yourgoogleemailname@gmail.com when using this method. Profuse apologies.\nA reader says: “Some clarification: I set up Gmail for a client for SMTP access, and we discovered the following huge drawback: Gmail automatically rewrites the “from” line of any e-mail you send via their SMTP gateway to your Gmail address, and it overrides any Reply-To settings you may have in your e-mail software in favor of the one in Gmail’s web interface. So while Gmail’s SMTP access sure is handy, it’s not a perfect solution for everybody.\nOn the plus side, Gmail also stores and indexes anything you send via SMTP as if you had sent it using the website, so all your e-mail is still searchable and in one place. Also, since Gmail SMTP does not use port 25, I’ve yet to see an ISP that won’t allow me to send mail through it.” Thanks, David!\nUpdate 2\nThe Gmail spooler is no longer available, but a reader says Gmail invites can be had at bytetest.com. Thanks, Darin!\nUpdate 2\nReader Derek Bennett says, “The solution is to go into your gmail Settings:Accounts and “Make default” an account other than your gmail account. This will cause gmail to re-write the From field with whatever the default account’s email address is.”\nSource: [www.lifehacker.com/software/email-apps/how-to-use-gmail-as-your-smtp-server-111166.php](www.lifehacker.com/software/email-apps/how-to-use-gmail-as-your-smtp-server-111166.php)\n"},"askpascal/home/iphone-applications":{"slug":"askpascal/home/iphone-applications","filePath":"askpascal/home/iphone-applications.md","title":"iphone-applications","links":["mailto:phonenumber@cingularme.com","mailto:4065551212@cingularme.com"],"tags":[],"content":"iPhone Applications\niPhone Applications\n\nStream music and videos from your computer with iPhone Remote\n\n  [code.google.com/p/telekinesis/](code.google.com/p/telekinesis/)\n\n\n\nLower cost international calls\n\n  [jajah.com/](jajah.com/)\n\n\n\nBandwidth Measurements(edge and WiFi:\n\n  [iphonenetworktest.com/](iphonenetworktest.com/)\n\n\n\nInteresting Python script to push exchange mail from OWA to the iPhone mailer\n\n [hackint0sh.org/forum/showthread.php](hackint0sh.org/forum/showthread.php)\n\n\n\niPhone Interface Tool (hack)\n\n The following are likely crap:\n    Windows: [unlockediphoneforsale.com/2007/07/iphone-hacking-news-update-iphoneinterface-tool-nearly-out/](unlockediphoneforsale.com/2007/07/iphone-hacking-news-update-iphoneinterface-tool-nearly-out/)\n    Mac: [www.megaupload.com/](www.megaupload.com/)\n\n\n\nMock Dock: an application launcher for the iPhone\n\n [mockdock.com/](mockdock.com/)\n\n\n\nSignal: an iTunes Controller for your iPhone\n\n    [www.alloysoft.com/](www.alloysoft.com/)\n\n\n\nVNC on the iPhone\n\n [cre.ations.net/creation/webvnc---remote-desktop--vnc-on-your-iphone](cre.ations.net/creation/webvnc---remote-desktop--vnc-on-your-iphone)\n\n\niPhone Tips and Tricks\n\nSend text messages to an iPhone by sending your text message to phonenumber@cingularme.com like 4065551212@cingularme.com.

He found that despite being supposed to switch back to the integrated graphic, some apps like Skype and Chrome force the use of the discrete graphic card hence reducing the battery life dramatically, Skype and Chrome are two know apps which forces the discrete graphic. Now for the solution, a small - free - app allows to control which card get uses in which condition:codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus It shows the icon on a toolbar showing which card is used, also allow you to lock specific card or to use auto switch mode. And the most important, you can force to use integrated card while on battery and leave default switching mode (or force discrete card) when on power source (this is in app preferences and you need to restart to make new preference active). Pretty cool, now I’m on the battery for 4 hours, and it still shows 3+ hours remaining.

The following trick enables the creation of a limited volume sized for Time Machine to retricts its backup size (handy).\nWhen you use TM with a network drive, it creates a .sparsebundle disk image to put the backup data into. The disk image has a capacity of 2.75 TB. The trick is to create another sparsebundle disk image of a given capacity (i.e. 300GB) on network disk. Use ‘Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled)’ as the volume format in Disk Utility. Name the volume the same as the volume used by Time Machine (it should be Backup of computerName), and save it to something like test.sparsebundle.\nNow, turn urn off Time Machine, mount your Time Machine backup image (by opening the .sparsebundle disk image on your network) and your newly-created disk image; use Disk Utility to ‘restore’ the Time Machine disk image into your new image. Click on the ‘Erase Destination’ button in order to allow Disk Utility to make a block copy of your Time Machine disk image. Wait for the process to finish.\nOnce finished, unmount both images and open a Finder window into your network drive. Note the name of the disk image used by Time Machine; it should be computerName_ABC123DEF.sparsebundle, where ABC123DEF is your MAC address. Delete this image, and rename your test.sparsebundle to this name. Then, restart Time Machine. Voila. It will use no more than the size your specified.\nSource: www.macosxhints.com/article.php\nDon’t like the new dock\nOpen Terminal and type:\n    defaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean YES\n\n\nMenu Bar\nOpen Terminal and Type:\nWhite Menu Bar\n sudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.WindowServer &#039;EnvironmentVariables&#039; -dict &#039;CI_NO_BACKGROUND_IMAGE&#039; 1\n\n\nWarning Sudo command so be careful.\nGrayish Menu Bar\n sudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.WindowServer &#039;EnvironmentVariables&#039; -dict &#039;CI_NO_BACKGROUND_IMAGE&#039; 0\n\n\nTranslucent Menu Bar\n sudo defaults delete /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.WindowServer &#039;EnvironmentVariables&#039;\n\n\nReplace your startup background picture\nSimply replace this file:\n    /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg\n\n\nReplace your stack icons\nStack icons are always changing, updating based on the top document in the stack.

If you write something, assume that it will be retained forever. This includes articles, user pages and talk pages. Some limited exceptions are described below. \nPublishing on the wiki and public data\nSimply visiting the web site does not expose your identity publicly (but see private logging below).\nWhen you edit any page in askPascal, you are publishing a document. This is a public act, and you are identified publicly with that edit as its author.\nIdentification of an author\nWhen you publish a page in askPascal, you may be logged in or not. At time this site may restrict publishing to logged users.\nIf you are logged in, you will be identified by your user name. This may be your real name if you so choose, or you may choose to publish under a pseudonym, whatever user name you selected when you created your account.\nIf you have not logged in, you will be identified by your network IP address. This is a series of four numbers which identifies the Internet address from which you are contacting the wiki. Depending on your connection, this number may be traceable only to a large Internet service provider, or specifically to your school, place of business, or home. It may be possible that the origin of this IP address could be used in conjunction with any interests you express implicitly or explicitly by editing articles to identify you even by private individuals.\nIt may be either difficult or easy for a motivated individual to connect your network IP address with your real-life identity. Therefore if you are very concerned about privacy, you may wish to log in and publish under a pseudonym.\nWhen using a pseudonym, your IP address will not be available to the public except in cases of abuse, including vandalism of a wiki page by you or by another user with the same IP address. In all cases, your IP address will be stored on the wiki servers and can be seen by Wikimedia’s server administrators and by users who have been granted “CheckUser” access. Your IP address, and its connection to any usernames that share it may be released under certain circumstances (see below).\nIf you use a company mail server from home or telecommute and use a DSL or cable Internet connection, it is likely to be very easy for your employer to identify your IP address and find all of your IP based Wikimedia project contributions. Using a user name is a better way of preserving your privacy in this situation. However, remember to log out or disconnect yourself after each session using a pseudonym on a shared computer, to avoid allowing others to use your identity.\nCookies\nThe wiki will set a temporary session cookie (PHPSESSID) whenever you visit the site. If you do not intend to ever log in, you may deny this cookie, but you cannot log in without it. It will be deleted when you close your browser session.\nMore cookies may be set when you log in, to avoid typing in your user name (or optionally password) on your next visit. These last up to 30 days. You may clear these cookies after use if you are using a public machine and don’t wish to expose your username to future users of the machine. (If so, clear the browser cache as well.)\nPasswords\nMany aspects of the Wikimedia projects’ community interactions depend on the reputation and respect that is built up through a history of valued contributions. User passwords are the only guarantee of the integrity of a user’s edit history. All users are encouraged to select strong passwords and to never share them. No one shall knowingly expose the password of another user to public release either directly or indirectly. Be smart, don’t use your most secret password on this site.\nPrivate logging\nEvery time you visit a web page, you send a lot of information to the web server. Most web servers routinely maintain access logs with a portion of this information, which can be used to get an overall picture of what pages are popular, what other sites link to this one, and what web browsers people are using.\nThese logs are used to produce the site statistics pages; the raw log data is not made public, and is normally discarded after about two weeks.\nHere’s a sample of what’s logged for one page view:\n127.0.0.1 - - [10/June/1971:05:23:44 +0000] “GET /wiki/index.php:Privacy_policy&amp;action=edit HTTP/1.1” 200 2690 “Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/85.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/85.5”\nLog data may be examined for many reasons such as solving technical problems and in tracking down badly-behaved web spiders that overwhelm the site. IP addresses of users, derived either from those logs or from records in the database are frequently used to correlate usernames and network addresses of edits in investigating abuse of the wiki, including the suspected use of malicious “sockpuppets” (duplicate accounts), vandalism, harassment of other users, or disruption of the wiki.\nPolicy on release of data derived from page logs\nIt is the policy of askPascal that personally identifiable data collected in the server logs, or through records in the database via the CheckUser feature, may be released by the system administrators or users with CheckUser access, in the following situations:\nIn response to a valid subpoena or other compulsory request from law enforcement With permission of the affected user When necessary for investigation of abuse complaints. Where the information pertains to page views generated by a spider or bot and its dissemination is necessary to illustrate or resolve technical issues. Where the user has been vandalising articles or persistently behaving in a disruptive way, data may be released to assist in the targeting of IP blocks, or to assist in the formulation of a complaint to relevant Internet Service Providers Where it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of askPascal. Just because.\nSharing information with third parties\nExcept where otherwise specified, all text added to askPascal de-facto belong to askPascal. Private information, such as email addresses, belongs to askPascal and while we do not intend to sell or share it with third parties, we may. Just being fallacious here, today I do not see who would care and I would be interested to know that you read this one all the way to here.\nSecurity of information\naskPascal and askPascal.com make no guarantee against unauthorized access to any information you provide. This information may be available to anyone with access to the servers. A partial list of those people can be found in the developers list. It is also possible this information becomes available to someone with illegal access (hack) to the servers.\nE-mail and mailing lists\nE-mail\nYou may provide your e-mail address in your Preferences and enable other logged-in users to send email to you through the wiki. Your address will not be revealed to them unless you respond, or possibly if the email bounces. The email address may be used by askPascal to communicate with users on a wider scale.\nIf you do not provide an email address, you will not be able to reset your password if you forget it. However, you may contact one of the administrators to enter a new mail address in your preferences.\nYou can remove your email address from your preferences at any time to prevent it being used…unless askPascal removes this feature.\nMailing lists\nIf you subscribe to one of the project mailing lists, your address will be exposed to any other subscriber. The list archives of most of askPascal’s mailing lists are public, and your address may find itself quoted in messages. The list archives are also archived by Gmane and other services. Mails are usually not deleted or modified.\nInformation email addresses\nSome email addresses (see below) may forward mail to a team to view them and answer them. By sending a mail to one of these addresses, your address may become public.\nAny addresses on askPascal.com, pascal@askPascal.com and pcrausaz@bigfoot.com may be redirected as needed.\nUser data\nData on users, such as the times at which they edited and the number of edits they have made are publicly available via “user contributions” lists, and in aggregated forms published by other users.\nRemoval of user accounts\nOnce created, user accounts will usually not be removed. It may be possible for a username to be changed but it may incur a fee. askPascal and askPascal.com do not guarantee that a name will be changed on request.\nWhether specific user information is deleted is dependant on the whim of askPascal and askPascal.com.\nDeletion of content\nRemoving text from askPascal.com does not permanently delete it. In normal articles, anyone can look at a previous version and see what was there. If an article is “deleted”, any user with proper access on the wiki, meaning almost anyone, can see what was deleted. Information can be permanently deleted by those people with access to the servers, but there is no guarantee this will happen.\nFree inspired from “wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikimedia:Privacy_Policy”"},"askpascal/home/public-key-pascal":{"slug":"askpascal/home/public-key-pascal","filePath":"askpascal/home/public-key-pascal.md","title":"public-key-pascal","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Public Key Pascal\nBEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----Version: PGP 8.0.2 - not licensed for commercial use: www.pgp.com\nmQGiBEEi7jgRBAD8GCWa3MR2nEzn8JnPqtMnlQkEzoNMkO/gnCbD2CL/oCUPNkwv XT94MxROGhfppEaK2bVaCFQff09eVNd15ratUYuMaL61vN5DC0wX+zjtxJ/0aQBv wnjMg58WbJbcrfnYKNo5bVYfd4ol/4MYVETHdua7UZp6Vl7D0whP33UbPwCg/0sr gMUL25420e8UFtH2DyJqiccD/Rvvoho9yVlxB9ZCs9bciJLk9v4251TL4hw27J/W mRnhSfVyQo59mRRnLbSdfwOSbUK7HsN+Fhe6qlYoi4TGoY9cTQQ0b1xqf93e/w4h 9jwbAokzF+Esw6HD9K3HNmtNjMwgoDmgoX4VbLmrlBsVn75RAeBOU7yYpUc0Xvea cndXA/0f6k8478fz04HsBQZ7ziwIp2ycSef7zWH09uZ5BybfRfl4UjdmSJrR9+Np T5aweV1rNScffD4Z45zLHfQWR73npfiFZvpzdZR4S7vLm/uksE76ygSH3R3HWv1f 7j0RTNmTnnrE4yR2zABaw3XgJ696sua7oVF+pM6LylARKbj157QkUGFzY2FsIENy YXVzYXogPHBjcmF1c2F6QGJpZ2Zvb3QuY28+iQBXBBARAgAXBQJBIu44BwsJCAcD AgoCGQEFGwMAAAAACgkQQ+QZz3gn456MOQCg9ES9cHU4E0kE595u9Bp3N/lhK0MA niRaGdc9raBmYj97qCVWPhTKtcstuQINBEEi7jgQCAD2Qle3CH8IF3KiutapQvMF 6PlTETlPtvFuuUs4INoBp1ajFOmPQFXz0AfGy0OplK33TGSGSfgMg71l6RfUodNQ +PVZX9x2Uk89PY3bzpnhV5JZzf24rnRPxfx2vIPFRzBhznzJZv8V+bv9kV7HAarT W56NoKVyOtQa8L9GAFgr5fSI/VhOSdvNILSd5JEHNmszbDgNRR0PfIizHHxbLY72 88kjwEPwpVsYjY67VYy4XTjTNP18F1dDox0YbN4zISy1Kv884bEpQBgRjXyEpwpy 1obEAxnIByl6ypUM2Zafq9AKUJsCRtMIPWakXUGfnHy9iUsiGSa6q6Jew1XpMgs7 AAICB/9qRGEVF5bek3UHAE116Upp/WS9kcT+25xTJCaT1fFCdohJHOng5PvniWnY mAaue/gwXVp9budtoE3eO6RJKo8ztPeWfv89hsmUbuSnlVHbzNOdUYUyDQ6qlPna 2vA6bwHJDhcoEQlS5+D2PiG/r3mN/56vzAn/ArhOr0gfXhClEUxjLFXIId7ZCM3/ eP2IqootzJDT7qrBJfqsVTkp5j8YUjNDeuTLjGZmxkLG2M9Jv0E2Fd3qutoAWGFr LesTJW9EJ/pyWfw0oF/lokRO2yR6jHEe28ROoYzxDVbCOhNslLP91VD2K9WAGax/ 8cexyHZHFhnups5+fIMN84S+uZlsiQBMBBgRAgAMBQJBIu44BRsMAAAAAAoJEEPk Gc94J+Oe/j4AniAYcpyDMBitL+oSDKuVAsNohs9+AJ9+HluHPCWRnIM6YmqmxwMy N66Ieg== =Vx9x\nEND PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\n"},"askpascal/home/reset-fkey-script":{"slug":"askpascal/home/reset-fkey-script","filePath":"askpascal/home/reset-fkey-script.md","title":"reset-fkey-script","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Reset FKey Script\nSorry I can not remember where I first found this script.\n\n(*\nExpose Fix\n\nIf you are going to modify this script, I recommend saving a copy and modifying the copy in the event you render it unusable!\n\nTo save as a Run Only Application, go to File-&gt;Save As...

Since the days of 10.2, if you added the Control key into the mix, the capture would go to your clipboard, instead of to a file. (This is a great way to grab a quick screenshot for an iChat session, by the way. Just Shift-Control-Command-4, drag around the area to capture, release the drag, then switch back to iChat and hit Command-V to paste.)\nBut with 10.5, Apple has found uses for the Shift, Space, and Option keys as well. This gets a bit complicated, but I’ll try to explain it clearly, then demonstrate with a short movie. If you start a region capture, either with or without the Control key, you can then change how the region selection area changes by using the following keys—note that you can release the original keys once the crosshairs appears, as long as you’ve started dragging your mouse, and you keep the mouse button down.\n\nSpace Bar: Press and hold the Space Bar, and the size of the current region is then locked and can be dragged around the screen. As long as you hold the Space Bar down, the region’s size is locked and it can be dragged about.\nShift: Press and hold the Shift key, and one side of the region will be locked, based on which way you then move the mouse. For instance, if you press and hold Shift, and then move your mouse down, you’ll only be able to resize the region vertically; the horizontal size will be fixed. Move the mouse left or right, and you can resize the region horizontally while holding the vertical size fixed.\nOption: Press and hold Option while dragging your region, and you’ll change the way the region grows as you drag. By default, your region is anchored at the upper left corner; when you press Option, the anchor point is moved to the center of the current region, and it expands in all directions from that point.\n\nTo make things even a bit more confusing, you can combine some of these keystrokes. Shift and the Space Bar together will allow a fixed-size region to be dragged in either a vertical or horizontal direction, depending on which direction you first move the mouse after pressing the keys. If you combine Shift and Option, then you can grow your region from the center, restricting either the vertical or horizontal size. As I said, it’s a bit confusing, so here’s a movie of the options in action.\nAs you can see, with these new modifier keys, there’s a lot more flexibility in capturing regions—either to a file, or to the clipboard when you add in the Control key.\nSource: www.macworld.com/article/131404/2008/01/screencapopts.html"},"askpascal/home/secure-subversion":{"slug":"askpascal/home/secure-subversion","filePath":"askpascal/home/secure-subversion.md","title":"secure-subversion","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Secure Subversion\nInstalling a secure SVN\nSource: www.sonzea.com/articles/subversion-trac.html\nCreate a subversion repository\nIf you don’t already have one, create a subversion repository:\n# cd /usr/local\n# svnadmin create repo\n\n\nNow create the basic structure and commit your changes to the repository.\n$ cd /tmp\n$ svn co file:///usr/local/repo\n$ cd repo\n$ svn mkdir tags branches trunk\nA         tags\nA         branches\nA         trunk\n$ svn ci -m &quot;initial structure&quot;\nAdding         branches\nAdding         tags\nAdding         trunk\n\n\nCommitted revision 1.\n\n\nEnable HTTP access\nConfigure Apache HTTPD to enable accessing our Subversion repository using HTTP:\nCreate a file called httpd-subversion.conf in /etc/apache2/extra and put this in the contents:\nLoadModule dav_svn_module     libexec/apache2/mod_dav_svn.so\nLoadModule authz_svn_module   libexec/apache2/mod_authz_svn.so\n\n&lt;Location /repo&gt;\n   DAV svn\n   SVNPath /usr/local/repo\n&lt;/Location&gt;\n\n\nAdd these lines to your httpd.conf file just after the SSL/TLS include:\n# Subversion\nInclude /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-subversion.conf\n\n\nNote that I am at times referring to the directory /etc and at other times I will refer to /private/etc. For the most part, it doesn’t matter which you use. Apple has symlinked /etc to /private/etc, and I have tried to follow their convention of referring to the directory as /private/etc where they have already established that naming, for example, in the httpd configuration files. Most of the time, however, I prefer the more standard convention of /etc.\nStop and restart the Apache HTTP server by unchecking and then checking web sharing in System Preferences or by issuing the apachectl restart command.\nOpen Safari, and try to access your repository. Enter http://localhost/repo in your address bar. If all is good you should see the three directories you created above. If you are having problems, the Console application (in /Applications/Utilities) is a good place to look.\nSo far so good, but this is not very secure. Anyone can access and also write to this repository. Lets work on securing it a bit.\nEnable SSL on your Web Server\nThe apache configuration shipped by apple does not have SSL turned on. Before we can do that, we need to have a certificate. I’m assuming you’re not planing on buying one from Verisign or Thawte so lets create our own! Here we will create self-signed certificates for Apache HTTP using the OpenSSL command line tools. These instructions have been adapted from the excellent resources at www.tc.umn.edu/~brams006/selfsign.html.\n  1. Generate your own Certificate Authority (CA)\n\n\n     # openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 4096\n     enter password\n\n\n     # openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt\n     re-enter password from above\n\n\n     Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]: US\n     State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]: State\n     Locality Name (eg, city) []: City\n     Organization Name (eg, company) []: company name\n     Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:\n     Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []: My CA\n     Email Address []:\n\n\n  2. Generate a server key\n\n\n     # openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 4096\n     Enter pass phrase for server.key: ****\n\n\n  3. Generate a certificate signing request (CSR)\n\n\n     # openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr\n     Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US\n     State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:State\n     Locality Name (eg, city) []:City\n     Organization Name (eg, company) []: company name\n     Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:\n     Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []: servername\n     Email Address []:\n     A challenge password []:\n     An optional company name []:\n\n\n     The servername entered for the CN should match your web server&#039;s DNS name.\n  4. Sign the CSR with the CA\n\n\n     # openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt \\\n     \t-CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out server.crt\n     Signature ok\n     subject=/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=company/CN=server\n     Getting CA Private Key\n     Enter pass phrase for ca.key: *****\n\n\n  5. Make an insecure version of the key\n\n\n     This is needed so that Apache does not prompt for a passkey every time it is started. However, you need to make sure to protect the integrity of the resulting server.key file.\n\n\n     # openssl rsa -in server.key -out server.key.insecure\n     Enter pass phrase for server.key:\n     writing RSA key\n     # mv server.key server.key.secure\n     # mv server.key.insecure server.key\n\n\n     # cp server.key /etc/apache2/server.key\n     # cp server.crt /etc/apache2/server.crt\n\n\n     # chmod 600 server.key\n     # chmod 600 server.crt\n\n\n  6. Edit /etc/apache2/httpd.conf and uncomment the include directive for the SSL configuration file. Change:\n\n\n     # Secure (SSL/TLS) connections\n     #Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-ssl.conf\n\n\n     to\n\n\n     # Secure (SSL/TLS) connections\n     Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-ssl.conf\n\n\n  7. Start and stop web sharing from system preferences.\n\n\nAt this point, your HTTPS server should be functional. In Safari type https://hostname/ in your address bar. You should see the root page of your installation. The same page you would see for http://hostname/.\nMake the Subversion repository require SSL\nAt this point we will edit the HTTPD configuration files so that any access to the repository must be done through HTTPS. This will be especially important later when authentication is enabled. If you attempt to perform Basic HTTP authentication over HTTP, the password will be transmitted in clear text. Performing Basic Authentication on a HTTPS connection is considerably more secure as the password will be transmitted in an encrypted form.\nAlso, lets edit the subversion.conf file so it looks like this:\nLoadModule dav_svn_module     libexec/apache2/mod_dav_svn.so\nLoadModule authz_svn_module   libexec/apache2/mod_authz_svn.so\n\n&lt;Location /repo&gt;\n   DAV svn\n   SVNPath /usr/local/repo\n\n   SSLRequireSSL\n&lt;/Location&gt;\n\n\nStart and stop web sharing from system preferences again.\nIn Safari type https://hostname/repo/ in your browser, you should see your repository. Try http://hostname/repo/ and you should get a Forbidden error.\nStill, we aren’t authenticating the user. The reason we set up SSL is so that we could use basic authentication and the password would not be passed in plain text. At this point setting up authentication is not that hard.\nThis is described in detail at svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.serverconfig.httpd.html#svn.serverconfig.httpd.authn.basic\nCreate the authentication file.\n# htpasswd -cm /etc/apache2/subversion.auth harry\nNew password: *****\nRe-type new password: *****\nAdding password for user harry\n# chmod 600 subversion.auth \n# chown _www /etc/apache2/subversion.auth \n\n\nI’ll give a basic configuration that allows for blanket access control. More complex examples are in the Subversion book at svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.serverconfig.httpd.html#svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz\nEdit your httpd-subversion.conf file again to look like this:\nLoadModule dav_svn_module     libexec/apache2/mod_dav_svn.so\nLoadModule authz_svn_module   libexec/apache2/mod_authz_svn.so\n\n\n&lt;Location /repo&gt;\n   DAV svn\n   SVNPath /usr/local/repo\n\n\n   # Require SSL connection for password protection.\n   SSLRequireSSL\n\n   # how to authenticate a user\n   AuthType Basic\n   AuthName &quot;Subversion repository&quot;\n   AuthUserFile /private/etc/apache2/subversion.auth\n\n   # only authenticated users may access the repository\n   Require valid-user\n&lt;/Location&gt;\n\n\nStop and restart the Web sharing again, and go back to Safari. When you access https://localhost/repo you should be prompted to log in. Log in using the credentials you created above, and Voila! you should be set.\nAt this point you have a functional and secure subversion server operating on port 443 using HTTPs. If thats enough for you, great! I also like to use TRAC in conjunction with subversion. Setting that up is straightforward with the tools that Leopard has provided us.\nHere, I’m going to describe how to do this using mod_fastcgi. Initially, I wanted to use mod_python, since that is how I like to run TRAC, and was running it before upgrading to Leopard. Unfortunately, the mod_python installation does not want to build a 64-bit binary, and the httpd in a fat binary containing 64 bit images, which my G5 happily runs. Until this is sorted out, I’ll use fast cgi.\nFirst, lets get TRAC running standalone.\nInstall TRAC\nThe TracInstall page lists several dependencies for TRAC, but many of these are happily included in Leopard, such as SQLite or Python 2.5. However, there are a few things you will need to obtain.\nFrom www.clearsilver.net/downloads/ get www.clearsilver.net/downloads/clearsilver-0.10.5.tar.gz\nExtract, configure and build\n$ tar xzf clearsilver-0.10.5.tar.gz \n$ cd clearsilver-0.10.5\n$ ./configure --with-python=/usr/bin/python\n$ make\n$ sudo make install\n\n\nperhaps also\n$ cd python\n$ sudo python setup.py install\n\n\nDownload the 0.10.4 TRAC distribution from ftp.edgewall.com/pub/trac/trac-0.10.4.tar.gz. Then extract and install the system:\n$ tar zxf trac-0.10.4.tar.gz\n$ cd trac-0.10.4\n$ sudo python ./setup.py install\n\n\nCreate your TRAC environment with\n$ sudo trac-admin /usr/local/trac initenv\n$ sudo chown -R _www /usr/local/trac\n\n\nStart the stand-alone server\n$ tracd --port 8000 /usr/local/trac\n\n\nOpen up your browser and go to http://localhost:8000/trac. Looks good!\nNow, kill that stand-alone server and lets get this running under Apache.\nConfigure Apache to run TRAC using FastCGI\nCreate a file at /private/etc/apache2/extra called httpd-fastcgi.conf and add the following contents:\n# Enable fastcgi for .fcgi files\n&lt;IfModule mod_fastcgi.c&gt;\n   AddHandler fastcgi-script .fcgi\n   FastCgiIpcDir /private/var/run/fastcgi \n&lt;/IfModule&gt;\n\nLoadModule fastcgi_module libexec/apache2/mod_fastcgi.so\n\n\nCreate a file at /private/etc/apache2/extra called httpd-trac.conf and add the following contents:\nScriptAlias /trac /usr/local/share/trac/cgi-bin/trac.fcgi\nFastCgiConfig -initial-env TRAC_ENV=/usr/local/trac\n\n\n&lt;Location &quot;/trac&quot;&gt;\n  SetEnv TRAC_ENV &quot;/usr/local/trac&quot;\n&lt;/Location&gt;\n\n\n&lt;Directory &quot;/usr/local/share/trac/cgi-bin&quot;&gt;\n    AllowOverride None\n    Options None\n    Order allow,deny\n    Allow from all\n&lt;/Directory&gt;\n\n\nAs before, add include directives into your httpd.conf file to these new files:\n# FastCGI\nInclude /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-fastcgi.conf\n\n\n# TRAC\nInclude /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-trac.conf\n\n\nRestart the server and try the URLS http://localhost/trac and https://localhost/trac. These should both work, but at this point you are not required to authenticate to access the TRAC project.\nSecure your TRAC installation\nAs with the Subversion repository above, the TRAC installation needs to be secured so that you are not transmitting sensitive information in the clear. Requiring authentication will have other benefits for TRAC as much of the bug tracking system works best when users are logged in as a specific user rather than as a guest.\nAdd the following to the Location block above to secure the TRAC site:\n # Require SSL connection for password protection.\n SSLRequireSSL\n\n\n AuthType Basic\n AuthName &quot;TRAC Project&quot;\n AuthUserFile /private/etc/apache2/subversion.auth\n\n\n Require valid-user\n\n\nRestart the server and then go back to https://localhost/trac. Your browser should now require authentication. And there you have it!\nSource: www.sonzea.com/articles/subversion-trac.html"},"askpascal/home/secure-vnc":{"slug":"askpascal/home/secure-vnc","filePath":"askpascal/home/secure-vnc.md","title":"secure-vnc","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Secure VNC\nSecure VNC (MacOS X to MacOS X)\nRemote Mac\n\nOpen System Preferences → Sharing → Apple Remote Desktop\n\nStart\nOpen Access Privilege\n\nSet Access Privileges to allow “VNC viewers may control screen with password”\nGive it a password.\n\n\n\n\n\nlocal Mac\n\nInstall [Chicken of the VNC]\nOpen a Terminal Window and type\n\nssh -L 5900:127.0.0.1:5900 username@remote.mac.addr.com\n\n\nStart [Chicken of the VNC] and connect to localhost on port 5900 display 0\n\nssh will tunnel your port 5900 traffic encrypted to the remote Mac.\nSecure VNC (MacOS X to Windows XP)\nRemote PC\n\nInstall VNC [UltraVNC]\n\nMake sure to set “allow loopback connections”\n\n\nInstall OpenSSH\n\nUse [CygWin]\n\nDownload the install and update utility\nMake sure to select the OpenSSH package (in the Net category)\nStart CygWin\nSet the password for the user\nConfigure SSH from the Cygwin console\n\n\n\n\n\n$ ssh-host-config\n\n- Answer yes to the priviledge separation question and to the create sshd user question\n- Answer yes to install ssh as a service\n- set CYGWIN=ntsec tty\n- Start ssh\n\n net start sshd\n\nYou can later on create a shortcut or bat file to start it automatically\nC:\\cygwin\\cygwin.bat  &quot;-S sshd&quot;\n\nFull details in www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/TIPS0408.html"},"askpascal/home/shared-links":{"slug":"askpascal/home/shared-links","filePath":"askpascal/home/shared-links.md","title":"shared-links","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Shared Links\nCreate shared link\n\n\n                  \n                  INFO\n                  \n                \n\n\n Tip: Share a link from anywhere by dragging this button → [Share on Confluence](javascript:(function(){var screenWidth=screen.width,screenHeight=screen.height,popupWidth=640,popupHeight=580,popupLeft=0,popupTop=0; if(screenWidth&gt;popupWidth){popupLeft=Math.round((screenWidth/2)-(popupWidth/2));}if(screenHeight&gt;popupHeight){popupTop=Math.round((screenHeight/2)-(popupHeight/2));}window.open(‘askpascal.atlassian.net/wiki/plugins/sharelinksbookmarklet/bookmarklet.action‘+encodeURIComponent(window.location.href), ”,‘left=‘+popupLeft+‘,top=‘+popupTop+‘,width=‘+popupWidth+‘,height=‘+popupHeight+‘,personalbar=0,toolbar=0,scrollbars=1,resizable=1’);}());) to your browser bookmarks toolbar.

But here’s only one most important thing to remember: when it comes to discussing your potential salary, never give the number first.\nThe right answer to the question, “What’s your salary range?” is almost always some version of “I’m not telling you.”\nThe person who gives the first number sets the starting point. But if that’s you, you lose. If you request a salary higher than the range for the job, the interviewer will tell you you’re high, and you’ve just lost money. If you request a salary lower than the range, the interviewer will say nothing, and you’ve just lost money.\nSo you can only hurt yourself by giving the first number. You want the interviewer to tell you the range for the position, because then you can focus on getting to the high end of that range. But you can’t work to the high point if you don’t know it.\nSo if there are two good salary negotiators in the room, it will be a game to see who has to give the first number. Fortunately, the company cannot make you an offer without also offering a salary, so the cards are stacked in your favor, as long as you hold your ground.\nSo here’s a list of responses for all the ways the interviewer will ask you how much money you expect to make. The more times you can fend off the question, the less likely you will have to be the one to give the first number. This works, even if you don’t have the upper hand and you really need the job.\nWhat salary range are you looking for? “Let’s talk about the job requirements and expectations first, so I can get a sense of what you need.” That’s a soft answer to a soft way to ask the question.\nWhat did you make at your last job? “This position is not exactly the same as my last job. So let’s discuss what my responsibilities would be here and then determine a fair salary for this job.” It’s hard to argue with words like “fair” and “responsibilities”—you’re earning respect with this one.\nWhat are you expecting to make in terms of salary? “I am interested in finding a job that is a good fit for me. I’m sure whatever salary your paying is consistent with the rest of the market.” In other words, I respect myself and I want to think I can respect this company.\nI need to know what salary you want in order to make you an offer. Can you tell me a range? “I’d appreciate it if you could make me an offer based on whatever you have budgeted for this position and we can go from there.” This is a pretty direct response, so using words like “appreciate” focuses on drawing out the interviewer’s better qualities instead of her tougher side.\nWhy don’t you want to give your salary requirements? “I think you have a good idea of what this position is worth to your company, and that’s important information for me to know.” Enough dancing–this is one last attempt to force you to give the number first. Hold your line here and you win.\nYou can see the pattern, right? If you think you sound obnoxious or obstinate by not answering the question, think of how he feels asking the question more than once. The interviewer is just trying to get a leg up on you in negotiations. If you give in, you look like a poor negotiator, and the interviewer is probably not looking for someone like that.\nSo stand your ground, and understand that the interviewer is being as insistent as you are. And it might encourage you to know that research shows that if you mirror the behavior of the interviewer, you are more likely to get the job. Sure, this usually applies to tone of voice, level of enthusiasm, and body language, but who’s to say it doesn’t apply to negotiation tactics, too? Try it. You could come away lots richer.\nSource: blog.penelopetrunk.com/2008/02/19/the-answer-to-the-toughest-interview-question/"},"askpascal/home/tidbits-about-pi":{"slug":"askpascal/home/tidbits-about-pi","filePath":"askpascal/home/tidbits-about-pi.md","title":"tidbits-about-pi","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Tidbits about PI\nSimple Fraction\n355/113\nCool Aproximations\nbetterexplained.com/articles/prehistoric-calculus-discovering-pi/ www.ams.org/featurecolumn/archive/pi.html \nNeed some digits\n3. 14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510 58209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679 82148086513282306647093844609550582231725359408128 48111745028410270193852110555964462294895493038196 44288109756659334461284756482337867831652712019091 45648566923460348610454326648213393607260249141273 72458700660631558817488152092096282925409171536436 78925903600113305305488204665213841469519415116094 33057270365759591953092186117381932611793105118548 07446237996274956735188575272489122793818301194912 98336733624406566430860213949463952247371907021798 60943702770539217176293176752384674818467669405132 00056812714526356082778577134275778960917363717872 14684409012249534301465495853710507922796892589235 42019956112129021960864034418159813629774771309960 51870721134999999837297804995105973173281609631859 50244594553469083026425223082533446850352619311881 71010003137838752886587533208381420617177669147303 59825349042875546873115956286388235378759375195778 18577805321712268066130019278766111959092164201989 38095257201065485863278865936153381827968230301952 03530185296899577362259941389124972177528347913151 55748572424541506959508295331168617278558890750983 81754637464939319255060400927701671139009848824012 85836160356370766010471018194295559619894676783744 94482553797747268471040475346462080466842590694912 93313677028989152104752162056966024058038150193511 25338243003558764024749647326391419927260426992279 67823547816360093417216412199245863150302861829745 55706749838505494588586926995690927210797509302955 32116534498720275596023648066549911988183479775356 63698074265425278625518184175746728909777727938000 81647060016145249192173217214772350141441973568548 16136115735255213347574184946843852332390739414333 45477624168625189835694855620992192221842725502542 56887671790494601653466804988627232791786085784383 82796797668145410095388378636095068006422512520511 73929848960841284886269456042419652850222106611863 06744278622039194945047123713786960956364371917287 46776465757396241389086583264599581339047802759009 94657640789512694683983525957098258226205224894077 26719478268482601476990902640136394437455305068203 49625245174939965143142980919065925093722169646151 57098583874105978859597729754989301617539284681382 68683868942774155991855925245953959431049972524680 84598727364469584865383673622262609912460805124388 43904512441365497627807977156914359977001296160894 41694868555848406353422072225828488648158456028506 01684273945226746767889525213852254995466672782398 64565961163548862305774564980355936345681743241125 15076069479451096596094025228879710893145669136867 22874894056010150330861792868092087476091782493858 90097149096759852613655497818931297848216829989487 22658804857564014270477555132379641451523746234364\nNeed More?\nwww.eveandersson.com/pi/digits/1000000.txt\nbellard.org/pi/pi2700e9/pidigits.html\nbellard.org/pi/pi2700e9/"},"askpascal/home/xbox360":{"slug":"askpascal/home/xbox360","filePath":"askpascal/home/xbox360.md","title":"xbox360","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"XBox360\nRestarting Internet Sharing Try something like this in a user daemon (use Lingon)\n sudo sh -c &#039;kill $(cat /var/run/bootpd.pid)&#039;\n\n\nMake Internet Sharing DHCP work with an Xbox/Xbox 360 Network\nMany people have noticed that the Xbox and Xbox 360 will not obtain an IP address from a Mac running Internet Sharing using DHCP. (Apparently some other devices have the same problem, but I don’t have any of them to test with.) One workaround is to simply set the Xbox to use a static IP, DNS server(s), etc. That will certainly work, but it may be inconvenient and is definitely inelegant.\nThis hint will allow your Xbox to obtain its IP, DNS info, and so on from the Mac using DHCP. You need to have administrator privileges on the Mac in question, and the procedure is different on 10.4 vs. 10.5. (Presumably older systems were similar to 10.4, but I haven’t tested on anything older than 10.4.10.).\n10.4:\nI haven’t had much time to interact with the 10.4 machine I have access to, so I haven’t tested this as much. Some variation on this procedure may be necessary to get the change to stick — in particular, you may need to perform it more than once, or start and/or stop Internet Sharing before performing it. Also, the restart at the end may be unnecessary (though you do need to start and stop Internet Sharing somehow). Please post your experience in the comments, if someone hasn’t already.\n  1. Start Internet Sharing if it&#039;s not already running.\n  2. Open NetInfo Manager, located in /Applications » Utilities. Authenticate as an administrator using the lock icon in the lower-left.\n  3. Navigate to the /config/dhcp node (so that dhcp is selected in the browser pane).\n  4. In the lower pane, find the reply_threshold_seconds property and change its value from 4 to 0.\n  5. Quit NetInfo Manager and then restart your Mac.\n  6. After the restart, open NetInfo Manager again and confirm that reply_threshold_seconds is still 0.\n\n\n10.5:\nThe following procedure is confirmed to work as written.\n  1. Start Internet Sharing if it&#039;s not already running.\n  2. In Terminal, type cp /etc/bootpd.plist /tmp/bootpd.plist\n  3. Stop Internet Sharing.\n  4. Open /tmp/bootpd.plist for editing using TextEdit or whatever.\n  5. Locate this section of the file, near the end:\n\n\n     &lt;key&gt;reply_threshold_seconds&lt;/key&gt;\n     &lt;integer&gt;4&lt;/integer&gt;\n\n\n  6. Change the value 4 to 0.\n  7. In Terminal, type sudo cp /tmp/bootpd.plist /etc\n  8. Start Internet Sharing.\n  9. If you want to, check that your change to /etc/bootpd.plist hasn&#039;t been reverted. \n\n\nSource: www.macosxhints.com/article.php"},"askpascal/home/xcode-change-__mycompanyname__":{"slug":"askpascal/home/xcode-change-__mycompanyname__","filePath":"askpascal/home/xcode-change-__mycompanyname__.md","title":"xcode-change-__mycompanyname__","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Xcode: Change MyCompanyName\nChange __MyCompanyName__\nTired of seeing __MyCompanyName__ in all your files?
