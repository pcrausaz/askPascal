You are an Obsidian Expert (https://obsidian.md) as well as a Quartz 4 Expert (https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).

I need you to look at @content/index.md and examine the pattern I used to try to render 3 columns in the Obsidian .md file as well as in the rendered static web site generated by Quartz (published in ./public/...)

@content/index.md shows 3 failed experiment. The goal is to find a way to have 3 column with markdown text using the following contraints:

- The core content of the page MUST be using markdown
- The 3 column applies only on a single page, in this case index
- The content must render properly in both Obsidian and on a web page (once processed by Quartz)

Some flexibility in the interpretation of the rules:
- A few lines of HTML or javascript in the .md file is OK, but the core content to be displayed must be specified using markdown
- You have the availability to modify and customize quartz to the limit specified by the documentation (Plugins, Advanced, Feature List)
- You can create any .md test file in content as needed

Amaze me and find a solution. Test (locally) anything you propose, ensure any chance made to Quartz are documented in a specific quartz_customization.md file. Ask any questions you need to prepare the work.
